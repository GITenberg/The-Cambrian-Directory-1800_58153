considered proper <i>avant couriers</i> to a Work, the omission
of either might be deemed an essential breach of literary
decorum:&mdash;I profess myself an Old Bachelor, and am
consequently anxious every minuti&aelig; should be properly
attended to.</p>
<p>It is generally customary in Dedications, to solicit the
patronage of an individual; but, as these <i>Cursory Sketches</i>
will fully prove, I by no means always pursue the common beaten
track, <a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

addressing myself to <i>Pluralities</i>, and humbly requesting
permission, that the <span class="smcap">Cambrian
Directory</span> may be looked upon as a Ward of the Welsh in
general: for I can with safety affirm, in no country will the
Tourist experience more true hospitality and friendly attention,
than in the Principality of Wales: I therefore with true respect
and gratitude, beg leave to subscribe myself,</p>

<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Faults</span>, in the following Work, I
readily allow, there are many, many; but, flatter myself, those
who are best able to discover, will be most ready to pardon
them.&nbsp; Tours or Journals, are now hackneyed subjects; and
though this may be considered as a trite apology, and (if I may
so express myself) an Author&rsquo;s loop-hole, yet I can most
truly assert, the present Observations were by no means at first,
ever intended to be scanned by the public eye; but merely for my
own private amusement, as a memento, to have access to, when I
wished to breathe delight from Recollection&rsquo;s power; my
Remarks, therefore, were only such as any Traveller, an admirer
of Nature, would with a pencil briefly put down; and I must beg
leave again to repeat, I had not then the most distant <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>thought of
appearing at the bar of the Public: on my return, I naturally
placed my Observations in a more connected form; and <i>some time
afterwards</i>, accidentally conversing with my Bookseller, on
the romantic beauties of Wales, and shewing him a few of my
Notes, was persuaded to prepare them for the press; in
consequence of which, I am now embarking on the literary ocean;
and, as a candid behaviour ought to be preferred to all other
considerations, before I sail on my cruize, beg leave to declare,
that it is not the intention of the following sheets, either to
rival the lively and impressive descriptions of a <span
class="smcap">Wyndham</span> or a <span
class="smcap">Warner</span>,&mdash;to contend with the literary
and historical anecdotes of a <span
class="smcap">Pennant</span>,&mdash;or to equal the mineralogical
studies of an <span class="smcap">Aikin</span>: and here I
candidly acknowledge, when attempting a description of
Monmouthshire, I found myself not a little intimidated, by the
intended, and anxiously expected publication of that county, by a
Gentleman, <a name="citationx"></a><a href="#footnotex"
class="citation">[x]</a> highly classed in the literary world, <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>for many
celebrated productions; conscious of my own inability to do ample
justice to that picturesque county, and particularly the rich
scenery of the Wye, when it is already in such able hands: I beg
from true respect and esteem, to apply to him the following
passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, while along the stream of time, thy name<br />
Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame.<br />
Say, shall my little bark attendant sail,<br />
Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Pope</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Cambrian Directory</span>, is
therefore given to the Public, as a <i>common Itinerary</i>; nor
does it presume to have discovered any thing unknown to the sage
Antiquarian,&mdash;the deep Mineralogist,&mdash;and the bustling
Traveller: still, however, the Author flatters himself, it may be
so far useful to the Public, that the Traveller will find it a
convenient Pocket Companion; it will tell him the <i>best
Inns</i>, and lay before him in one view, the <i>distances</i>;
the Mineralogist may occasionally learn, what Rocks will most
deserve his attention; and it will point out to the <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>Antiquarian, every venerable Ruin, that seems to tell
the religious or military history of the country.&nbsp; Such is
the &ldquo;plain unvarnish&rsquo;d tale:&rdquo; in addition to
which, I solicit permission to address my Readers with a line
from a favourite Author:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Laugh where you
<i>Must</i>, be candid where you <i>Can</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> Friends, equally admirers of
Nature&rsquo;s landscapes, and attached to pedestrian
independence, agreed to visit the wild and impressive scenery of
the Cambrian Mountains; and the outlines of their Route being
arranged, sallied forth in the month of July, 1798, from</p>
<h3>CHELTENHAM,</h3>
<p>a place much resorted to during the summer months, and
celebrated for its Mineral Waters, is composed of <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>one street, in
almost a straight line, nearly the length of a mile.&nbsp; Since
it has become a place of fashion, the lodging houses have been
considerably improved, and rendered comfortable for the company,
who make this place their summer residence.&nbsp; The season
usually commences about May, and frequently continues till the
beginning of November.&nbsp; The majority of the company who
frequent Cheltenham, resort here not so much for the purpose of
water-drinking, as to enjoy the delightful walks and rides, and
partake of the sociability of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Walk at the Pump-room, well planned, and kept in excellent
order, is planted on each side with limes; at the end is a small
square, where the Pump is situate, with a room on the left for
the accommodation of the company to promenade, measuring
sixty-six feet by twenty-three;&mdash;on the opposite side a
reading-room, with a billiard-table over, and a house, the
residence of the attendant at the Spa; beyond that, is a similar
walk of three hundred and twelve feet, which leads to another
serpentine walk; from the end of this, the Spire of Cheltenham
Church forms a beautiful object.&nbsp; Near these walks, stands,
on an eminence, the Seat of the Earl of Fauconberg: this was the
Royal residence during their Majesties stay at this place, from
July 12th to August 16, 1788.</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>In
respect to the rides, Cleave-hill, Dowdeswell, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Tewkesbury and Gloucester, are most admired.</p>
<p>Speaking of the History of the place, we find Cheltenham was a
town in the reign of William the Conqueror: Edward likewise is
supposed to have marched through it, before he encamped his army
on the field of Tewkesbury, previous to the battle of the Houses
of York and Lancaster.</p>
<p>Of the efficacy of the Water, to which this town is indebted
for its present celebrity, I refer my readers to a Treatise,
published by Dr. Fothergill, of Bath.</p>
<h3>GLOUCESTER.</h3>
<p>The Pin Manufactory was established here, by John Tisley, in
the year 1626, and the business is now become so extensive, that
the returns from London alone are estimated at near
20,000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i>&nbsp; Before the introduction of
Pins into England (1543) skewers of brass, silver, and gold, and
likewise thorns curiously scraped, called by the Welch women
<i>pin-draen</i>, were used.&nbsp; Though the Pins themselves are
apparently simple, yet their manufacture is not a little curious
and complex.&nbsp; The wire in its most rough state is brought <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>from a wire
company in the neighbourhood of Bristol: till the year 1563,
English iron wire was drawn out by manual strength.&nbsp; The
first operation attending this curious process, is the fixing the
circular roll of wire to the circumference of a wheel, which in
its rotation throwing the wire against a board, with great
violence, takes off the black external coat: vitriol is next
applied to bring the brass to its common colour.&nbsp; The brass
wire being too thick for the purpose of being cut into Pins, is
reduced to any dimension the workman pleases, by forcibly drawing
it through an orifice in a steel plate, of a smaller
diameter.&nbsp; The wire, being thus reduced to its proper
dimensions, is next straightened: it is then cut into portions of
six inches in length, and afterwards to the size of the Pin, and
each piece respectively sharpened on a grinding-stone, turned by
a wheel.&nbsp; We now come to a distinct branch of the
manufactory: the forming the heads, or, as the workmen term it,
<i>head spinning</i>: this is accomplished by means of a
spinning-wheel, which, with astonishing rapidity winds the wire
round a small rod: this, when drawn out, leaves a hollow tube
between the circumvolutions; every two circumvolutions, or turns,
being cut with sheers, form one head.&nbsp; The heads, thus
formed, are distributed to children, who, with great dexterity,
by the assistance of an anvil, or hammer, worked by the foot, fix
the point and the head together.&nbsp; The Pins, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>thus formed,
are boiled in a copper, containing a solution of block-tin
pulverized, and the lees of Port; and by this last process, it
changes its yellow brassy colour, and assumes the appearance of
silver, or tin.&nbsp; The labourers are all paid according to the
weight of their work.</p>
<p>Near Gloucester, at the small island of Alney, formed by the
river Severn, historians relate, that Canute and Edmund, after
many bloody engagements in Essex, determined to prevent a farther
effusion of blood by a single combat.&nbsp; Neither, however, as
the story relates, obtaining a victory, peace was concluded, and
the kingdom divided between them.&nbsp; We paid, however, little
regard to the supposed place of this contest, as it was not for
us, puisne antiquarians, to discuss points, on which the greatest
historians had so materially differed.</p>
<p>I forbear to make any remarks on the Cathedral and Gaol of
Gloucester, as much has already been done towards their
illustration; and as ample accounts of them are given in the
Gloucester Guide, which the Tourist will meet with on the
spot.</p>
<p>The Walk from hence to</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>WESTBURY,</h3>
<p>is by no means uninteresting; the country is studded with
half-seen villas, and animated with churches, whilst the
retrospect commands a fine view of Robin-hood&rsquo;s Hill, with
the dark Tower of Gloucester Cathedral, just rising in the
perspective.</p>
<p>At Westbury is the Seat of Maynard Colchester, Esq.&nbsp; The
Church, with a detached Spire, stands close to the house.&nbsp;
Near this place mineralogists will be highly gratified by
visiting a Cliff, called <i>Garden</i>, or <i>Golden Cliffe</i>;
which is most beautifully encrusted with mundic and
crystals.&nbsp; This rock, standing close to the Severn, is only
accessible at the reflux of the tide; and when illuminated by the
sun wears a most beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>Between Westbury and Newnham, in an extremely delightful
valley, bordering on the Forest of Deane, is situate</p>
<h3>FLAXLEY ABBEY,</h3>
<p>the Seat of Sir Thomas Crawley Bovey.&nbsp; This valley was
formerly called <i>Castiard</i>, or the <i>Happy Valley</i>; <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and a
Monastery, for Cistercian Monks, was founded here by Roger, the
second Earl of Hereford, and the charter confirmed by Henry
II.&nbsp; The Abbey was standing till the year 1777, when part of
it was unfortunately consumed by fire; since that a considerable
portion of building has been added, and is become a very
desirable summer residence.&nbsp; The Views from the park, behind
the house, are very extensive, commanding the Vale of Gloucester,
and the River Severn, gay with vessels, whilst the extensive
Forest of Dean, and Flaxley Abbey, form nearer objects for
admiration.&nbsp; This wood abounds with the most charming walks;
and, while it affords refreshing shelter from a summer&rsquo;s
sun, admits partial views of the adjacent country.&nbsp; Camden,
in speaking of the Forest of Dean, derives its name from Ardene,
a wood in the Gaulic and British languages.&nbsp; It lies between
the two rivers Severn and Wye, and contains thirty thousand
acres.&nbsp; The soil is well adapted for the growth of oaks, and
forest timber; and the situation particularly commodious for
exporting it for ship-building, and other purposes.&nbsp; The
immense quantities of wood annually felled for the use of the
navy, have so thinned this wood of its timber, that it is now
preserved till a certain growth by act of parliament.&nbsp;
Camden observes, that the oak of this Forest was so considerable,
that the Spanish Armada had orders to <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>destroy the timber of it in 1588: it
suffered considerably in the great rebellion.</p>
<p>The Iron Manufactory has long been carried on in this Forest;
and to this day immense beds of iron cinders are found, the
reliques of the Romans.&nbsp; These cinders are not half
exhausted of their ore, and are consequently worked over again: a
proof that the Romans knew only the weak power of the foot
blast.</p>
<p>As we drew near</p>
<h3>NEWNHAM,</h3>
<p>the Severn became more considerable.&nbsp; The town, situated
on the banks of the river, and backed by the Forest of Dean, is
very ancient, and in 1018 this manor was granted by King Canute
to the Benedictine Abbey of Pershore, in Worcestershire. <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>The Church-yard affords a variety of objects worthy the
attention of the passing stranger, amongst which the Church of
Westbury forms the most conspicuous feature in the landscape.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The View,
previous to our descending the hill to</p>
<h3>LIDNEY,</h3>
<p>is extensive and beautiful.&nbsp; In this place Iron Works are
carried on by a Mr. Pitchcock.&mdash;About a mile from Lidney,
the Old Passage,&mdash;King&rsquo;s-road, with the merchant ships
lying off Bristol,&mdash;Gloucestershire and Somersetshire hills,
studded with gentlemens&rsquo; seats, churches, and half-seen
cottages, formed a cheerful landscape.</p>
<h3>CHEPSTOW.</h3>
<p>The weather prevented our seeing the celebrated Walks of
Piercefield, but we promised ourselves the pleasure of visiting
them on our return down the Wye.&nbsp; The Castle of Chepstow,
called Kaswent, or Castelk Gwent, stands on a rock washed by the
river Wye, near its influx into the Severn.&nbsp; Topographical
writers differ in their accounts concerning the antiquity of the
Castle, but it is generally supposed to have been built at the
same time with the town, appearing at that period to have been a
kind of citadel to Chepstow. <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; The <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Castle was
formerly of great extent, as, according to Leland&rsquo;s
account, the &ldquo;waulles began at the end of the great bridge
over Wy,&rdquo; yet &ldquo;in the castel ys one tower, as I heard
say, by the name of Langine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Little now remains of
its former grandeur: but, impelled by an irresistible curiosity,
we ascended the decayed steps of the tower, from whence the eye
traced with pleasure the windings of the Wye, till it was at last
lost in its conjunction with the Severn.&nbsp; With horror we
examined the dark dungeon, where Henry Martin, one of the twelve
judges, who sat to condemn Charles I. was confined seven and
twenty years.</p>
<p>Grand views of the Bristol Channel still continued to form
interesting objects from the road; but about three miles from
Chepstow, we turned into some fields on the right, to examine the
Ivy-mantled walls of</p>
<h3>CALDECOT CASTLE.</h3>
<p>On our first entrance we gazed with that wrapt astonishment,
that fears to disturb, or be disturbed by the mutual
communication of thought.&mdash;Mr. Warner, in his survey of this
ruin, was much disappointed; but I cannot help allowing, although
the view from it was inferior to Chepstow, yet its antiquated
walls wear a <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>nobler appearance; and the gloom that reigns around it,
forces a sigh, and evinces the transitory nature of sublunary
greatness.&nbsp; The antiquity of the building is very obscure:
it is situate on a flat, and memorable for the birth of Henry
VII.&nbsp; Passing through the village of Caldecot, we soon
entered</p>
<h3>CAERWENT,</h3>
<p>on the Western side, through the broken fragments of its
walls, of which one immense mass has recently fallen.&nbsp; This
ancient town is now little more than a village, with a few
scattered cottages, but formerly celebrated, under the auspices
of Agricola, for its temples, theatre, porticos, and baths; few
vestiges of its former splendour are now extant.&nbsp; A few
fragments of loose stones only remain to point out its former
extent.&nbsp; In an orchard, adjoining a farm-house belonging to
Mr. Lewis, is the beautiful tessalated Roman Pavement, discovered
in the year 1777.&nbsp; The tesserale or dies, about an inch in
breadth, and half in depth, are nearly cubical, consisting of
four colours, red, yellow, blue, and white, <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> which are still in great preservation;
the whole is surrounded with a border, much resembling a Turkey
carpet.&nbsp; The daily <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>depredations on these curious remains
of antiquity are greatly to be lamented.</p>
<p>In the road from Caerwent, amongst other objects for
admiration, the Mansion of Sir Robert Salisbury, on the left,
commanding an extensive view, attracted our notice.&nbsp; Passing
through the neat village of Christchurch, animated with
white-washed cottages, and graced with its simple Church, which
stands on an eminence, we left the turnpike road, at the 13th
mile stone; and following a footpath through some fields, near
the banks of the Uske, soon entered the ancient city of</p>
<h3>CAERLEON,</h3>
<p>over a wooden bridge, built on the same plan as
Chepstow.&nbsp; This city was formerly a metropolitan see, but
St. David, the national saint of Wales, thinking the noisy
intercourse of a populous city, like Caer-Lleon, ill adapted for
contemplation, or the solitary cast of his mind, removed it to
Menevia, which from that period has been called Ty Dewi by the
Welch, and St. David by the English. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; The remains of
its ancient grandeur <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>are still discernible.&nbsp; Whilst
tracing the extent of its amphitheatre, surrounded by a circular
entrenchment, and the grandeur of its porticoes, we took a
retrospect on the exertions of man, the fate of kingdoms, and of
rulers; and, marking the grand destruction of ages, it seemed to
convince us of the transientness of human worth and
happiness!&nbsp; The ships in the Bristol Channel, with Flat and
Steep Holmes rising in the midst of the sea, formed pleasing
objects in the distant view, whilst the mellow green of nearer
woods, and meadows watered by the Uske, made a combination of
hues gay and beautiful.</p>
<p>Near</p>
<h3>NEWPORT</h3>
<p>a new stone bridge is erecting by contract for 10,165<i>l.</i>
by Mr. Edwards, son to the Edwards, who built the famous Pont y
Pridd.&nbsp; It is to consist of five arches.</p>
<p>Newport Castle, standing on the bank of the river Uske, is a
small distance from the bridge: it evidently appears to have been
once a place of considerable extent, and built for the defence of
the passage over the river; three strong towers commanded the
Uske, but towards the town a common wall, without any flanks,
seems to <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>have been its sole defence.&nbsp; Some of the windows
still remain, the relics of Gothic architecture, and appear to
have been elegantly decorated.&nbsp; From the tower is a fine
view of the Uske.&nbsp; Between Newport and</p>
<h3>CARDIFF</h3>
<p>we crossed the little stream of Ebwith, near the park of
Tridegar House, belonging to Sir Charles Morgan.&nbsp; The
grounds are well planned, and command the hills of Machan and
Tombal&oelig;, with the church of Passaness rising in the centre,
on an eminence.&nbsp; The whole valley, indeed, is prettily
situated.&nbsp; Passing through the villages of Pediston and
Castletown, we soon reached the bridge of two arches, over the
river Romney, which divides England from Wales.</p>
<p>The situation of Cardiff is on a low flat, near the mouth of
the Taafe, over which has lately been thrown a new Bridge, built
by Mr. Parry in 1796: it consists of three large and two smaller
arches.&nbsp; The tower of the church is very light, and of
elegant workmanship; but nothing in the inside is worthy of
inspection.</p>
<p>The Castle derives its name from the river Taff, which washes
its walls; <i>Caertaph</i> signifying the Town <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>or Castle
upon Taff.&nbsp; Robert Fitzham having conquered Glamorganshire,
divided the country into different portions, among the twelve
Norman Knights, as a reward for their service, and took for his
own share the Town of Cardiff; and erected, in the year 1110,
this Castle, in which he generally resided, and held his court of
chancery and exchequer.&nbsp; In the beginning of May 1645,
during the troubles under Charles I. it was in the possession of
the Royalists, but it was surrendered to Parliament before August
1646.</p>
<p>We entered the Castle by two strong gates, which still remain
in great preservation, but we were disgusted with the modern
architecture of the new-built mansion, erected by the late
Marquis of Bute: the neat shorn grass, the gravel walk, were
circumstances that ill accorded with the mutilated walls of an
ancient ruin, which has braved the storms of so many
centuries.&nbsp; The circumstance that tends to render this
Castle a melancholy place in history, is the unjust confinement
of Robert Duke of Normandy, brother to William Rufus and Henry
I.&nbsp; The accounts, however, of his confinement have been
greatly exaggerated by historians; and a dark vaulted room,
beneath the level of the ground, measuring nearly a square of
fifteen feet and a half, is still pointed out as the place of his
confinement; a small crevice in the top, about half a yard in
length, <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>and three inches wide, was the only place to admit the
air.&nbsp; He was buried in Gloucester Cathedral, where his
effigy as big as life, carved in Irish oak, and painted, is yet
shewn.&nbsp; The Keep, which is still very perfect, of an octagon
shape, stands on an eminence in the centre of a large
square.&nbsp; Having walked round the ramparts, which command
extensive views of the adjacent country, we visited the Castle
itself, which has, within these few years, been repaired, but
still remains in an unfinished state.&nbsp; In the Dining-room
are some portraits, in length, of the Windsor family: the most
striking are,</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; Sir William, who first raised forces for Queen
Mary.</p>
<p>2d.&nbsp; Sir Edward, who first entered the breach at the
taking of St. Quintin, in Flanders, where the famous Constable de
Montmorency was taken prisoner.</p>
<p>In the Breakfast-parlour is a family piece, consisting of
seven figures: it was painted in the year 1568.&nbsp; Holbein, I
rather imagine, was the painter: it consists of two Sisters
playing at Cards, and two Brothers at Drafts, with Edward Earl of
Windsor and his lady looking on.&nbsp; The style is stiff, with
ruffs, small black caps and feathers.</p>

<p>This Castle belongs to a grandson of the Marquis of Bute.</p>
<p>In this place, Robert Earl of Gloucester founded a Priory of
White-friars, and another of Black, which continued till the
reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp; Only the <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>shell of the White-friars is now
extant, and the ruins of the Black-friars are inhabited by
fishermen.</p>
<p>From hence we walked to inspect the remains of that once
celebrated city</p>
<h3>LANDAFF;</h3>
<p>the ruins of the old Cathedral are very beautiful, the door
cases are all Norman architecture elegantly moulded; two of
which, on the North and South sides, are fine specimens of that
&aelig;ra.&nbsp; All the other parts are Gothic: the nave is
unroofed.&nbsp; Within these ruins we entered the Cathedral,
which carries with it more the appearance of a modern theatre,
than a place of divine worship, so erroneous was the taste of the
architect, in combining with the sacred Gothic, a fantastical
work of his own.&nbsp; Among several ancient monuments, are two
very elegant ones of the Mathews family, <a
name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a> whose descendants own the scite of the
Bishop&rsquo;s Castle, of which only the gate remains: the rest,
with the Archdeacon&rsquo;s house, was destroyed by Owen
Glendour. <a name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a>&nbsp; There are likewise the monuments
of two bishops, with another, and the figure of Lady Godiva, full
length, carved in marble on it.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Landaff
stands on a small eminence, commanding a view of Cardiff, and the
surrounding country.&mdash;We returned again to Cardiff: and the
first six miles of our road to</p>
<h3>CAERPHILY</h3>
<p>were not very interesting, till ascending Thorn Hill, the
beauties of the vale below, with Flat and Steep Holmes rising in
the distant prospect, the ruins of Cardiff Castle, and the
ivy-mantled walls of Landaff Cathedral, amply compensated for the
trouble of climbing this eminence.&nbsp; A little farther on,
Caerphily Castle burst upon our sight, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;seem&rsquo;d to frown,<br />
In awful majesty on all around.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The founder, and the time of its erection are very uncertain;
but I refer my readers to the first volume of the
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>; to an ingenious Dissertation, by Daines
Barrington, where it is satisfactorily proved to have been the
work of Edward I.&nbsp; This Castle is one of the noblest ruins
of ancient architecture now remaining in the kingdom, and exceeds
all in bigness, except that of Windsor.&nbsp; The Hall and the
Chapel may still be traced; the former measures about seventy
feet in length, thirty-four in breadth, and seventeen in
height.&nbsp; <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>The roof is vaulted about eight feet high, and supported
by twenty arches.&nbsp; On the North side is a chimney, ten feet
wide, with two windows on each side, extending down to the floor,
and carried above the supposed height of this room.&nbsp; At each
angle was originally a round tower of four stories, communicating
with each other by a gallery.&nbsp; On the West side of the Hall
stairs, is a low round tower, of one story, called the
Mint-house, with three painted arches on the South side, and a
square well on the West.&nbsp; The leaning tower, towards the
East end, more particularly engaged our notice: it is divided
into two separate parts, by a large fissure, which runs from the
top down almost to the middle.&nbsp; Its lineal projection is
supposed to be on the outer side, about eleven feet and a
half.&nbsp; On the West and North are visible vestiges of a
draw-bridge.&nbsp; The East wall, on the South side of the
principal entrance, is fluted between the buttresses, with
battlements on their tops, to protect the intermediate walls.</p>
<p>At Caerphily we perceived a great change in the manners of the
people; in the whole village, scarcely one person was capable of
speaking English.</p>
<p>We now came to the celebrated vale of Glamorganshire, so
justly styled the <i>Garden of South-Wales</i>; the <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>rapid Taafe
forms an almost continued uproar for many miles; on the opposite
side the mountains rose almost perpendicularly in a massy wall,
and sometimes to the water&rsquo;s edge, finely clothed with
wood.&nbsp; Every circumstance conspired to heighten the solitary
grandeur of the scene, and to prolong the luxurious melancholy,
which the views inspired.&nbsp; In this celebrated vale is found
the famous Pont y Pridd, or New Bridge, about three quarters of a
mile from the Duke of Bridgewater&rsquo;s Arms, a comfortable
inn, and far surpassing our miserable quarters at
Caerphily.&nbsp; This wonderful bridge, of one arch, is the
segment of a circle; the chord of it is one hundred and forty
feet, and the heighth of the key-stone, from the spring of the
arch, thirty-two feet and a half.&nbsp; It was erected, in the
year 1750, by William Edwards, a country mason, who failed in his
attempt three times, till, by lightening the abutments, it has
resisted, for many years, the torrents of the Taafe.</p>
<p>The intrusion of art in this romantic valley, where nature has
been so lavish of her beauties, is much to be lamented: a canal,
for the purpose of conveying the iron from the Myther Works to
Cardiff, renders it a place of frequent business and confusion; a
place originally so well adapted to retirement and
reflection.</p>
<h3><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>MYTHER
TIDVIL,</h3>
<p>is a most miserable dirty place; the soil and the inhabitants
both partook of a dark dingy colour: the women destitute of shoes
and stockings, the men and boys the slaves of Vulcan.&nbsp; The
Iron-works, under the direction of Mr. Cramshaw, are the largest
in the kingdom; not less than one thousand hands are employed by
this gentleman, who allows the person who inspects the machinery
one-eighth of the profits, to keep them in repair.&nbsp; Four
large blast furnaces, with a number of a smaller size, besides a
row of forges, are continually in use.&nbsp; An enormous wheel
has lately been constructed, with several inferior ones, acting
in contrary directions, which pumps the air into a large space,
from whence it is distributed, through various tubes, to each
separate furnace.&nbsp; This wheel is fifty feet one inch in
diameter, and six feet eight inches in width.&nbsp; The whole
weight rests on gudgeons, of one hundred tons.&nbsp; The gudgeons
of all the wheels, and of such parts of the machine where there
is any friction, have water continually running over them, to
prevent their taking fire.&nbsp; It is the particular office of
one man to grease every part of the machine, whilst in motion; to
accomplish which, he is frequently obliged to ride on an iron
bar, similar to the lever of a pump when in motion, a
considerable <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>way from the ground.&nbsp; The whole of this machinery
is worked by water, not more than a foot deep, which is conveyed
by a long spout to the top of the wheel, where it discharges
itself.&nbsp; The ore, flux, <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a> and coals, which
they use to promote the fusion of the ore, are all found on the
spot.&nbsp; The ore, previous to its being thrown into the
furnace, is burnt in a common lime-pit, the goodness of it
afterwards proved, by its adhesion to the tongue; the coal is all
charked, and continually put in the furnace, with certain
proportions of ore.&nbsp; From the pigs, the iron is rolled into
flat plates by a cylinder; this is performed with the greatest
dispatch.&nbsp; The gaunt figures of the workmen excite both pity
and terror, and the sallow countenances and miserable air of the
people, prove it is a labour very prejudicial to their
health.&nbsp; From hence we travelled the road to</p>
<h3>PONT NEATH VECHAN,</h3>
<p>inaccessible for carriages, indifferent for pedestrians, and
affording nothing worthy our attention.&nbsp; It lay over a
barren heath, with mountains on one side, and a dreary waste of
land before us.&nbsp; About a mile and a half from Vechan, we
unexpectedly descended through a wood into a rich romantic
valley, watered by Neath <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>River.&nbsp; In this retired
situation we found the Angel Inn, of Pont Neath Vechan.&nbsp;
Description can scarcely suggest the full grandeur and
magnificence of this valley: woods, rocks, and waterfalls, all
unite, to render it <i>beautiful</i>.&nbsp; Our Ciceroni first
conducted us to the fall of Scotenogam, on the river Purthen,
about a mile and a half from the house: this fall we saw to great
advantage, the river having gathered in its course the
accumulation of many torrents after the rain, precipitates itself
in one majestic expanse of water, near seventy feet high; whilst
the dark lowering rocks, on each side, contrasted finely with the
varied vegetation around us.&nbsp; The descent is by no means
easy, but the grandeur of the scene amply compensated for all
difficulties.&nbsp; Our Ciceroni next conducted us to a very
inferior one, called the Lady&rsquo;s Cascade, on the river
Neath; but of this we caught a very indifferent prospect, the
ascent of the mountain being inaccessible, and the water too high
to admit of our obtaining a due inspection of it.&nbsp; We then
returned to our inn, and set out a different road, in quest of
nature&rsquo;s landscapes.&mdash;Having walked about three miles,
we heard the angry roar of small cascades; this we considered as
preludes of scenes, where the water-fall swells into a torrent;
and we soon found ourselves near the fall of Lower
Culhepste.&nbsp; The character of this cataract differs very much
from that of Scotenogam; being broken in its <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>descent from
projecting rocks, of an immense size.&nbsp; About a quarter of a
mile from hence, we descended a rugged and steep rock to examine
the fall of Upper-Culhepste, about fifty feet high.&nbsp; The
singularity of this fall invites the curiosity of the traveller
more than any other in Wales: the whole river precipitates itself
with such violence, as to leave a space between the rock and the
fall sufficiently wide for a horse path.&nbsp; Though in less
than two minutes we were completely wet by the spray, yet the
effect was awful and sublime; and it was necessary to remember
the fixed foundation of the rocks above our heads, to soften the
awe they inspired.&nbsp; Near this fall is Porthogo Cavern,
through which the river Vendre runs.&nbsp; The water was too high
to admit our entrance; our Conductor, however, informed us, he
had penetrated about half a mile, but found the river wind so
many ways, he judged it safer to return, lest he should share the
fate of a poor man, who lost himself in this Cavern for the space
of three days.&nbsp; On our return, a very intelligent gentleman,
staying in the neighbourhood, strenuously recommended us to
descend a steep mountain, on our left, to survey a curious
quadrangular strata of marble in the rock below.&nbsp; With some
difficulty we effected our purpose, having waded twice through
the river.&nbsp; This strata in Welch is called <i>Bwr Maen</i>,
which signifies a Stone Bow: it is situated close to the river
Dynnas, which, forcing its <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>way through some broken fragments of
the rock, forms a cascade a little above.&nbsp; The price offered
for this grey marble, in London, is fifteen shillings a foot
square.</p>
<p>About five miles from Vechan is the Seat of Mrs. Holbrow, on
the right.&nbsp; We were prevented visiting the water-falls of
Melincourt and Aperdulas, the river, owing to the late floods,
being too deep to ford.&nbsp; Our route still continued through
the valley we had so much admired the evening before.&nbsp; As we
drew near</p>
<h3>NEATH,</h3>
<p>the Tower of Knole Castle had a pleasing effect from a
distance: it was built by Sir Herbert Mackworth, and is at
present in the possession of Lady Mackworth.&nbsp; The windows
from the banqueting-room comprehend a circle of many miles
diameter, composed of Neath Valley and River, with the smoky Town
of Neath,&mdash;the Mumbles Point&mdash;Swansea, and the
Channel.&nbsp; The artificial cascade is well contrived, but,
after the foaming torrents of Scotenogam and Culhepste, appears
very tame.</p>
<p>The scite of the Refectory, the Chapel, the Hall, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>and several
other rooms in the ruins of Neath Abbey, may still be
traced.&nbsp; It stands on the East of the river, and was
formerly, by Leland&rsquo;s account, the &ldquo;fairest abbay of
all Wales;&rdquo; but in his <i>Collecteana</i> <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> he seems to give Margam the preference
of all the Cistercian houses in these parts.&nbsp; It was founded
for White Monks by Richard Granville.&nbsp; In this Abbey, the
unfortunate Edward II. secreted himself till he was taken.&nbsp;
Near the ruins are the Copper-works.&nbsp; The ore is chiefly
imported from Cornwall, and Wicklow in Ireland; being calcined,
and thereby losing its sulphur, it is refined by the simple
process of frequent melting, and taking off the dross, which
forms a scum; lastly, being moulded into small plates, or pigs,
it is shipped for the market.&nbsp; The method of reducing the
metal, when melted into small particles, is by pouring it into
water, and, when thus reduced, it is called <i>Copper
Shot</i>.&nbsp; Brass is a compound of copper thus reduced, and
<i>lapis calaminaris</i>, pulverized in crucibles, and moulded or
cast into plates.&nbsp; <i>Lapis calaminaris</i> is dug in great
quantities near Holywell, in Flintshire.</p>
<p>The Town of Neath is very unpleasantly situated, and generally
covered with the smoke of the Copper-works; a circumstance which
I should imagine renders <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>it an unhealthy spot.&nbsp; On that
account it is advisable, both for horsemen and pedestrians, in
their way to Swansea, to take the road by Britton Ferry, in
preference to the turnpike, which the smoke always renders
offensive.</p>
<h3>BRITTON FERRY.</h3>
<p>This village is much resorted to, on account of its beautiful
situation; and many a white-washed cottage straggles through the
hamlet.&nbsp; The plantations of Lord Vernon are well disposed,
and edge the water&rsquo;s brink: the river is constantly filled
with vessels, whose gay streamers glittering to the sun-beam,
present to the eye a constant moving object.&nbsp; Having crossed
the Ferry, we proceeded on the sands to</p>
<h3>SWANSEA.</h3>
<p>The whole of this walk commanded a boundless view of the ocean
to the West, whilst to the South the faint hues of Somersetshire
coast skirted the horizon.</p>
<p>Swansea is a well-built sea-port town, on the river Tawe, much
resorted to during the summer months.&nbsp; The machines for
bathing are kept about half a mile <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>from the town, under the direction of
Mrs. Landey, who likewise keeps a lodging-house near the place:
the charges are twenty-five shillings a week, board and lodging,
and ten shillings and six-pence a week for a private
parlour.&nbsp; The Castle is supposed to have been erected by
Henry Earl of Warwick, in the reign of Henry I.: the small arches
round the top of it are exactly similar to the building of
Lantphey Castle, and King John&rsquo;s Hall, St. David&rsquo;s,
Pembrokeshire.&nbsp; This Castle is now turned into a goal and
workhouse.&nbsp; The Market-place is said to be covered with the
lead of St. David&rsquo;s Cathedral, given by Cromwell to a
gentleman of Swansea.</p>
<p>The clay used for the Pottery, long carried on in this place,
is brought from Corfe, in Dorsetshire; having been mixed with
finely-ground flint, and dissolved in water, it is passed through
sieves, till it has lost all its coarser particles, then exposed
to heat, which evaporates the water, and leaves the clay of a
consistency sufficient for working.&nbsp; The vessel is first
rudely formed by the hand, the clay being stuck to a circular
board, which has an horizontal rotation.&nbsp; The other
operation consists in the more perfect forming of the work by
various processes, and the colouring, glazing, painting, and
stamping, drying and baking kilns complete the work.</p>
<h3><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>OYSTERMOUTH CASTLE,</h3>
<p>about five miles from Swansea, is finely situated on an
eminence, commanding a delightful prospect of the surrounding
country, and the Mumbles&rsquo; Bay.&nbsp; The ivy-mantled walls
of this Castle are sufficiently perfect, to distinguish what the
apartments were originally designed for.&nbsp; It formerly
belonged to the lords of Gower, but is now in the possession of
the Duke of Beaufort.&nbsp; Our curiosity being satisfied, we
hastened to the</p>
<h3>MUMBLES,</h3>
<p>celebrated far and near for the goodness and abundance of its
oysters.&nbsp; This village stands at the extremity of Swansea
Bay, on a vast mass of splinter&rsquo;d rock: from this
elevation, the wide expanse of the ocean and Swansea Bay are
viewed to great advantage.&nbsp; These rocks are inaccessible at
high-water, except in a boat; on the farthest is erected a
light-house.</p>
<p>At Pennard, we descended some immense sand-banks, which led us
into Oxwich Bay: at the head of the sand-banks are the small
remains of an old castle, <a name="citation30"></a><a
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a> <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>scarcely
worthy of observation.&nbsp; The sands in this bay are extremely
fine, and the bold projections of the rock exhibit nature in her
most awful and impressive attitudes.&nbsp; To the right of Oxwich
Bay is situate, at Penrice, the Seat of Mr. Talbot: the grounds
are well planned, and command extensive views of the sea: the old
Castle rising behind the house gave the whole a fine effect.</p>
<p>Between Penrice and the neat village of</p>
<h3>CHERITON,</h3>
<p>we observed to our right, on a hill, a large flat stone,
several tons weight, resting on about six smaller ones, placed
perpendicularly, and standing about five feet high: this is
vulgarly called <i>King Arthur&rsquo;s Stone</i>.&nbsp; It is
here proper to forewarn both Tourists and Travellers, not to fix
on Pennard, Penrice, or Cheriton, as places for a night&rsquo;s
abode, as they cannot possibly be comfortably accommodated.&nbsp;
This advice I mention from experience, for at the latter place,
we were under the necessity of contenting ourselves with tables
or chairs, as substitutes for beds, and even destitute of
necessary provisions.&nbsp; On a hill, opposite our inn, we
discovered evident vestiges of a Roman encampment; <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>from this
elevation the eye caught a fine view of Carmarthen Bay, and the
bold promontory of Worm&rsquo;s Head, to the South-west: this
rock is only accessible at low water.</p>
<p>The country through which we traversed for the four or five
last miles, is inhabited by a colony of Flemings, who settled
here in the reign of Henry I.&nbsp; In the reign of this
King&rsquo;s Father, a great number of Flemings, having been
driven out of their habitations, by a very extraordinary
inundation of the sea, sought protection in England, where they
were cordially received.&nbsp; But so many of these people being
dispersed in different parts of the kingdom, began, by increase
of their numbers, to create some uneasiness; which Henry I.
removed, by settling them as a colony in South Wales, and gave
them the country adjoining to Tenby and Haverfordwest.&nbsp; By
this wise policy, the King rid his own dominions of an
incumbrance, and curbed the insolence of the then rebellious
Cambrians. <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; The little territory they inhabit
is called <i>Gwyr</i>, and by the English, <i>Little England
beyond Wales</i>, because their manners and language are still
distinguishable from the Welsh, and, in point of speech,
assimilate the English.&nbsp; These Flemings, to this day, seldom
or never intermarry <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>with the Welsh: they speak good English, and are very
much averse to the manners and language of the country they
inhabit; both sexes generally distinguish themselves by wearing a
short cloak, called <i>Gowyr Wittle</i>.</p>
<p>In preference to a long walk, of near thirty miles, we crossed
the River Bury, as the pleasantest and most expeditious way
to</p>
<h3>LLANELLY,</h3>
<p>a miserable, dirty place, filled with miners and
sailors.&nbsp; From hence to</p>
<h3>KIDWELY,</h3>
<p>the road leads over the Penbree Hills; and from this
elevation, the Scenery is viewed to great advantage.</p>
<p>The Castle of Kidwely, otherwise, <i>Cathweli</i>, was
formerly, I imagine, of great extent, and is still the most
perfect we had hitherto met with in Wales, The extent of the
apartments are distinguishable; some of the staircases
accessible; and the four round towers, <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>keep, gateway, and yard, spread an
awful gloom around, whose beauties time had just sufficiently
impaired, to heighten its grandeur and sublimity.&nbsp; Our Guide
expatiated much on the History and Events of the Castle, and told
the story with as much agitation and interest, as if it had
happened yesterday.</p>
<p>The road to</p>
<h3>CAERMARTHEN,</h3>
<p>we found unpleasantly hilly, but occasional Vallies to our
left enlivened our walk.&nbsp; Near Caermarthen we crossed a
Bridge of free-stone over the Towy.&nbsp; This River, running
through the middle of this shire, falls into the British Sea at
Caermarthen Bay, and is navigable for small vessels as far as the
Bridge.&nbsp; Immediately over it, upon a hanging rock, stand the
remains of a once renowned Castle.&nbsp; This Town, according to
Giraldus&rsquo;s authority, was anciently a place of great
strength, and fortified with brick walls, which are yet partly
extant, near the river.&nbsp; This place, now considered as the
Capital of the county, was formerly the residence of the Prince
of South-Wales; and the Ancient Britons here held their
Parliaments.&nbsp; The Chancery likewise, and Exchequer for
South-Wales, <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>were kept here, when this territory was first erected
into a Principality, by the crown of England.&nbsp; In the
thirty-eighth year of Henry VIII. it was created a
borough-town.</p>
<p>This place is famous for being the birth-place of Merlin, who
is styled, by an ancient author, &ldquo;the sonne of a badde
angell, or of an incubus spirit, the Britaine&rsquo;s great
Apollo, whom Geoffrey ap Arthur would ranke with the South-saying
Seer, or rather with the true Prophets themselves; being none
other than a meere seducer, and phantasticall
vizard.&rdquo;&nbsp; He flourished in the year 480.</p>
<p>At the Inn (Old Ivy-Bush) Sir Richard Steel composed his
celebrated Play, called the <i>Conscious Lovers</i>.</p>
<p>From Caermarthen, we were recommended to go to</p>
<h3>LAUGHARNE,</h3>
<p>in order to see the Castle, but it by no means answered our
expectation: little part of it now remains; and the neat
gravel-walk, in the garden, but ill accords with the mutilated
walls of an ancient ruin.&nbsp; From the garden walks, grand and
extensive Sea-prospects interest <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the traveller.&nbsp; About five miles
from Laugharne, we passed a small place, called</p>
<h3>GREEN BRIDGE.</h3>
<p>It derives its name from an excavation in the rock, through
which a little rivulet runs for a mile and a half.&nbsp; This
cavity is completely concealed from the road, and impossible to
be discovered, unless pointed out by some neighbouring
inhabitant.&nbsp; Let me, however, advise all Tourists to be
cautious in their excursions to this natural curiosity, as it is
a place evidently calculated for plunder, stratagems, and murder;
and is now infested by an unawed banditti of smugglers, who have
frequently practised the barbarous scheme of decoying vessels by
false lights; and by whom we ourselves were insulted.&nbsp;
Indeed, I would advise Travellers to alter their route from
Swansea, and pursue the straight road to Caermarthen, and so to
Tenby, by Narbeth.&nbsp; By these means they escape the
unpleasant roads, (and almost, indeed, inaccessible for
carriages,) leading from Oystermouth to Cheriton, and likewise
from Llaugharne to Tenby.&nbsp; But should the Tourist be led by
an invincible curiosity to inspect the Ruins of Kidwely Castle,
it may easily be accomplished, by pursuing the Turnpike-road to
Kidwely, and from thence to Caermarthen: <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>in this last
route you only omit visiting the Seat of Mr. Talbot, of Penrice;
though an object highly worthy of inspection.</p>
<p>At Saunders&rsquo; Foot is a small Bay, formed on one side by
a rock called the Monkstone, and on the other by the
Caermarthenshire coast.&nbsp; Near this place is situate the Seat
of Capt. Ackland; and from thence to Tenby, the dark lowering
rocks rose perpendicularly to a considerable height, and then
branched out into overhanging crags.&nbsp; It was now
dusk;&mdash;and at this transforming hour, the bold promontories
became shaded with unreal glooms,&mdash;the projecting cliffs
assumed a more terrific aspect,&mdash;and the wild, overhanging
underwood,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Wav&rsquo;d to
the gale in hoarser murmurs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>TENBY,</h3>
<p>is much resorted to, during the summer months, for
bathing.&nbsp; It stands on a rock facing Caermarthen Bay: the
bold Promontory of the Monkstone Head to the North, and St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Point, to the South, form a fine
Amphitheatre.&nbsp; The shore is well adapted for bathing, the
machines excellent, and a singular rock, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>rising in the
sea, close to the shore, shelters the bathing machines, even in
the most boisterous weather.&nbsp; On the South of Tenby, at the
extremity of the small Island of St. Catherine&rsquo;s,
attainable at low water, are the remains of a Roman Catholic
Chapel.&nbsp; Entirely through this Island is a singular
perforation, which, without any difficulty, may be penetrated at
the reflux of the tide.&nbsp; The Views from the South Sands are
remarkably beautiful; the character of the rocks is here awfully
wild, craggy, and impending; and the distant fishing-boats with
their white sails, and the voices of the fishermen, who
constantly frequent this coast, borne at intervals on the air,
are circumstances which animate the scene: whilst the islands of
Caldy and St. Margaret&rsquo;s opportunely rise, to render the
terrific ocean beautiful.&nbsp; The retrospect is equally
interesting; the neat town of Tenby, with the mutilated walls of
its Castle, closes this charming scene.</p>
<p>The ancient walls of Tenby are still sufficiently perfect, to
shew its former strength and extent; and the four round towers,
standing on the extremity of the rock, point out the situation of
its Castle.&nbsp; Near this is a ruinous building, supposed to be
the remains of a Flemish manufactory, probably woollen.&nbsp; On
the North Sands is likewise another walk, equally beautiful,
commanding the whole extent of Caermarthen <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Bay.&nbsp; On
the summit of the rocks, over these sands, is the walk, called
the <i>Croft</i>: on this eminence is situated the Hotel kept by
Mr. Shaw; the accommodations are very good: the charges
<i>per</i> week are eighteen shillings board, finding your own
tea, sugar, wine, and porter; six shillings for a bed-room, and
at the same rate a private parlour.</p>
<p>This place, from the vast quantity of fish caught near the
coast is called <i>Tenby-y-Piscoid</i>.</p>
<p>If the Tourist has leisure and opportunity, many excursions
may be made during his stay at Tenby.&nbsp; The first, and most
important is, to Pembroke and Milford-Haven.&nbsp; The road
affords many grand and extensive Sea Views, with a faint prospect
of Lundy Isle.&nbsp; About four miles from Tenby, stand the ruins
of Mannorbeer Castle, supposed to have been erected about the
time of William Rufus.&nbsp; A little farther on, the ivy-mantled
walls of Carew Castle <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> burst upon us; and
about three miles from Pembroke, the decayed and broken walls of
Llanfeth, or Lantphey Castle, attracted our notice, once the
residence of the Bishops of St. David&rsquo;s, but now a monument
of desolation.&nbsp; The three buildings of Swansea <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Castle,
Lantphey Court, and King John&rsquo;s Hall, St. David&rsquo;s,
are very similar in their workmanship.&nbsp; We now arrived
at</p>
<h3>PEMBROKE,</h3>
<p>Mr. Wyndham has so minutely delineated the Present State of
this Castle, that I cannot do better than transcribe his
account.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The approach (says this Author) to Pembroke
from the River, shews the Town and Castle to the most beautiful
advantage.&nbsp; The Town is situated upon the ridge of a long
and narrow rock, gradually ascending to the highest point, on
which stands the Castle, at the brink of the precipice.&nbsp; If
I may compare small things with great, it much resembles the
situation of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Castle is of Norman architecture, mixed with early
Gothic.&nbsp; The principal tower, which is uncommonly high and
perfect, has even its stone vaulted roof remaining.&nbsp; The
walls of this tower are fourteen feet in thickness, the diameter
of the space within is twenty-five, and the heighth, from the
ground to the crown of the dome, is seventy-five <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>feet; but
visible marks appear within, that its heighth was originally
divided by four floors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry VII. was born in the present Castle.&nbsp; The
natural Cavern, called the Wogan, lies immediately under the
Chapel, and opens with a wide mouth towards the river.&nbsp; A
communication from the Cavern to the Castle, was made by a
stair-case, on the outside of the rock; the entrance was
barricaded with a strong wall, partly remaining, through which
there is now a large door-way opened to the shore of the
river.&nbsp; The Cavern appears nearly circular; its diameter is
fifty-three feet; and its height is proportionable to the
diameter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Civil War this Castle was a garrison for the
Crown, and being besieged, made a gallant defence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Pembroke we hired a boat, <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> intending to sail
round the extensive Haven of Milford; and, as we retired from the
shore, we took a retrospect of the dilapidated walls of the
Castle, once the terror, and even in ruins the pride of the
scene.&nbsp; It is most advisable to make this excursion at high
water, as it adds much to the picturesque scenery of the <i>tout
ensemble</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>MILFORD HAVEN,</h3>
<p>is justly compared to &ldquo;an immense lake; for the mouth
not being at any distance visible, the whole Haven seems
land-locked.&nbsp; Though it is a mile and three quarters wide,
it could not be defended against an enemy, nor is there a
sufficiency of timber in the neighbourhood. <a
name="citation42a"></a><a href="#footnote42a"
class="citation">[42a]</a>&nbsp; This Haven is formed by a great
advance of the sea into the land, it being above ten miles from
the Southernmost point at Nangle to Pembroke, beyond which the
tide comes up to and beyond Carew Castle.&nbsp; It is capable of
holding the whole navy of England, and the same is said of Cork
Harbour. <a name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a> The spring tides rise thirty-six feet,
the neap above twenty-six.&nbsp; Ships may be out of this Haven
in an hour&rsquo;s time, and in eight or ten hours over at
Ireland, or at the Land&rsquo;s End, and this with almost any
wind, by day or night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our reception at the
miserable place of</p>
<h3>HUBBERSTON,</h3>
<p>did not induce us to stay longer than was sufficient to
recruit ourselves.&nbsp; We found the dirty Inn pre-occupied <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>by
unfortunate Irish refugees: their situation was indeed
melancholy;&mdash;driven from their country, their friends, and
all most dear to them!&mdash;And, wishing to forget their past
sufferings, the following lines seem applicable to their
situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh! cou&rsquo;d oblivion&rsquo;s friendly
draught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooth all our sorrows to repose;<br />
Nor that intruder, restless thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Renew our agonizing woes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all, unconscious of the past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The present hour might calmly glide;<br />
Keen retrospect no more be cast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s tempestuous, changeful
tide:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Heaven, to all its creatures kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With peace can gild the deepest gloom;<br />
And, mid misfortune&rsquo;s wrecks, the mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May sweet serenity assume.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having refreshed ourselves, we walked to Milford, a small
Village, opposite Hubberston: several comfortable houses are
situated on the Hill, commanding a delightful View of the
Haven.&nbsp; Being satisfied with our day&rsquo;s excursion, we
again returned to our comfortable quarters at</p>
<h3><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>TENBY,</h3>
<p>which we left with regret a few days afterwards.&mdash;We
again pursued the Pembroke road; and, about two miles from Tenby,
the neglected walls of Carew Castle invited
curiosity;&mdash;and,</p>
<blockquote><p>Deep struck with awe, we marked the dome
o&rsquo;erthrown,<br />
Where once the Beauty bloom&rsquo;d, the Warrior shone;<br />
We saw the Castle&rsquo;s mouldering tow&rsquo;rs
decay&rsquo;d,<br />
The loose stone tott&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er the trembling
shade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Castle, I imagine, was intended more for a noble
residence, than a place of defence.&nbsp; The walls of this
building are very thick, and constructed with stones, of a large
size, strongly cemented with mortar.&nbsp; It is situated on a
branch of Milford Haven, and consists of a range of apartments
built round a quadrangle, with a circular tower at each
corner.&nbsp; The South wall is entirely demolished; but the
North consists of a spacious hall, measuring one hundred and two
feet by twenty, supposed to have been built by Sir John Perrot:
above and under this hall, are noble apartments, and extensive
offices.&nbsp; This Castle appears to have been erected at
different times, if we may judge from the architecture.&nbsp;
Every ledge of the walls of the <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>towers, denoting the different
stories, were embossed with vegetation, which seemed to grow from
the solid stone.&nbsp; Over the gate-way, at the West side, are
the arms of England, Duke of Lancaster, and Carew; and contiguous
to this entrance, is another spacious room, measuring eighty feet
by thirty.</p>
<p>In the Farm-yard, adjoining the Church, which has a lofty
square Tower, is a dilapidated stone-building, called the
Parsonage.</p>
<p>Leaving Carew, we crossed a small Bridge over an arm of
Milford Haven, and continued our route across a barren and
uninteresting heath; till, descending to the Village of</p>
<h3>CRESSELEY,</h3>
<p>the luxuriant Plantation of Firs, belonging to Sir William
Hamilton, attracted our attention.&nbsp; Small vessels constantly
frequent this quay, from whence a quantity of small coal is
shipped to different parts.&nbsp; From hence the road is
extremely barren and unpicturesque; but, about three miles
from</p>
<h3><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>LANDSHIPPING,</h3>
<p>an arm of Milford Haven again burst upon our sight.&mdash;Near
it is situated the uninhabited house of Sir William Owen.&nbsp;
In crossing the Ferry, Picton Castle, the property of Lord
Milford, formed a prominent feature in the gay scene; and
Slebitch, the Seat of Mr. Philips, standing at the end of the
Haven, contributes considerably to this picturesque prospect.</p>
<p>The grounds of</p>
<h3>PICTON,</h3>
<p>through which we passed, about five miles in extent, seemed to
be well planned, and kept in excellent order.</p>
<p>This Castle has always been inhabited; and having escaped the
fate of all other Castles in Wales, during the civil wars, it
retained, till very late, much of its original external
form.&nbsp; It is now occupied by Lord Milford, and rendered a
very comfortable summer residence.&nbsp; At the extremity of the
Park, a good turnpike-road soon conducted us to</p>
<h3><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>HAVERFORD-WEST,</h3>
<p>which is considered as one of the largest Towns in
South-Wales.&nbsp; It is very irregularly built, on the declivity
of a hill, which is, in some parts, so very steep, that the
ground-rooms frequently overlook the neighbouring roofs; yet
there are some good houses.&nbsp; It is considered as a County of
itself, and sends one Member to Parliament.&nbsp; The Town was
formerly fortified by a strong wall, or rampart, on the Western
summit: the shell of a once-extensive Castle, is still remaining;
this is now converted into a goal.</p>
<p>The Parade, commanding a cheerful View of the neighbouring
Country, and the ruins of an ancient Abbey, extends for a
considerable way, by the side of a hill.&nbsp; At the extremity
of this Walk, stand the ruins of an ancient Priory of Black
Canons: the remains are now very inconsiderable, but we easily
traced the Chapel, over one end of which is an arch, still in
good preservation, and beautifully enwreathed with the rich
drapery of ivy.</p>
<p>Haverford is called by the Welch, <i>Hwlfordh</i>. <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; Having <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>finished our survey of Haverford, we
started early the next morning, purporting to breakfast at</p>
<h3>NEWGIN BRIDGE,</h3>
<p>where we understood we should meet with every thing
comfortable; but, to our disappointment, we found a most
miserable, dirty pot-house, destitute of even the common comforts
of life.&nbsp; We were literally obliged to stoop, in order to
gain access to the Kitchen, which contained a small bed, and a
few chairs; through this an elderly woman conduced us to what she
distinguished by the name of a Parlour: in this room the
furniture consisted of two beds, a dirty table, and a few
chairs.&nbsp; With disgust we left this miserable hovel, and
contented ourselves with a bason of milk: we declined eating the
bread, or rather oatmeal cake, which was of the coarsest and
hardest nature.&nbsp; I here recollected Shenstone&rsquo;s
complimentary lines on an Inn, but could not apply them on the
present occasion:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;Whoe&rsquo;er has travell&rsquo;d life&rsquo;s
dull round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where&rsquo;er his stages may have been,<br />
May sigh to think that he has found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The warmest welcome at an Inn.&rdquo; <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The road from Haverford to Newgin we found very uninteresting;
and the shell of</p>
<h3>ROACH CASTLE</h3>
<p>did not detain us long.&nbsp; It stands on a rocky eminence,
now completely in ruins, with only one tower remaining.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Roach Castle (says Leland) in Rouseland, to the right of
the road to St. David&rsquo;s, shews a round and some double
out-works, visible at a great distance.&nbsp; It belonged to the
Lords Ferrars and old Langeville, Knt. of Bucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In descending the hill to Newgin, the dark lowering rocks,
which form that fine Bay, called St. Bride&rsquo;s, exhibited a
grand prospect.&nbsp; In the centre of this Bay is situated
Newgin, bounded on the South by the Island of Skomar, and on the
North by Ramsay.&nbsp; The fields adjacent to this place have
been frequently inundated, <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>by extraordinary overflowings of the
sea: at the reflux of the tide, the sands admit of most excellent
walking.</p>
<p>The saunter from hence to the City of</p>
<h3>ST. DAVIDS,</h3>
<p>now properly deserving the name of a Village, was rather more
captivating than our walk before breakfast: it was occasionally
enlivened by the prospect of the wide ocean, boundless to our
view on one side, whilst before us the fantastic shapes of the
rocks off St. David&rsquo;s Head, exhibited Nature, in her most
awful and striking attitudes.&nbsp; Above the rest, Caern Thydy
lifted its bold promontory, as if to give effect to the rude
landscape.&nbsp; About half way between Newgin and St. Davids,
the beautiful little Village of Solva unexpectedly burst upon our
view; studded with neat white-washed cottages, and enclosed on
each side with lofty rocks, which here form a picturesque and
interesting chasm.&nbsp; These rocks, indeed, I could almost
imagine, were torn asunder by some convulsive rent of the
earth.&nbsp; The Cathedral, and dilapidated ruins of the
episcopal Palace, are situated at the bottom of a steep hill, and
scarcely visible in the town: these, and the prebendal houses,
were formerly enclosed by a strong stone wall, with four gates,
computed <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>at eleven hundred yards in circuit.&nbsp; David, <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> the national saint of Wales, with the
consent of King Arthur, is said to have removed the Metropolitan
See from C&aelig;r Lleon to Menevia, which has ever since been
called <i>Ty Dewi</i>, by the Welch, and St. David, by the
English.&nbsp; What was the condition and extent of this town
formerly, is difficult to say, having been so frequently
destroyed.&nbsp; At present it is a very small city, and has
nothing to boast, but its ruined palace, and old cathedral,
dedicated to St. Andrew and St. David, which has often been
demolished, but rebuilt, in its present form, by Bishop Peter,
according to Giraldus, in the reign of Henry II. or as Willis,
1110, in Rhos Vale, below the town.&nbsp; It is still esteemed a
noble pile, consisting of two transepts, measuring in length,
from East to West, three hundred feet, and the body, with the
aisles, seventy-six feet broad.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behind the choir is a most beautiful
chapel, with a rich roof of carved stone, built by Vaughan, in
the <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>time
of Henry VIII. as a kind of presbytery, between the choir and
Lady chapel.&nbsp; In the last, whose roof, as well as those of
the ailes of the choir and transepts, have been down ever since
the civil war, are monuments for three bishops, and in the nave,
&amp;c. four or five more.&nbsp; In the North wall of the choir
is the shrine of St. David, a kind of altar tomb, with a canopy
of four pointed arches, and in front four quatrefoil holes, into
which the votaries put their offerings, which were taken out by
the Monks at two iron doors behind.&nbsp; In the choir are also
the monuments of Owen Tudor, second husband of Queen Catharine,
Rhys ap Tudor, <a name="citation52a"></a><a href="#footnote52a"
class="citation">[52a]</a> Bishops Jorwerth and Anselm, in the
13th century, and Edmund Earl of Richmond, father of Henry
VII.&nbsp; This last monument is said to have prevented Henry
VIII. from removing the see to Caermarthen.&nbsp; Giraldus
Cambrensis, who was Archdeacon of Brecon, canon of Hereford, and
Rector of Chesterton, Oxford, was buried here 1213. <a
name="citation52b"></a><a href="#footnote52b"
class="citation">[52b]</a>&nbsp; On the North side of the church
are some walls of St. Mary&rsquo;s College, founded by Bishop
Houghton, and John of Gaunt, 1365, valued at 106<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation52c"></a><a
href="#footnote52c" class="citation">[52c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>It is
much to be regretted, that so little regard has been paid to the
internal appearance of this noble pile; the whole of it has
lately been white-washed, which gives it too much the air of a
modern building: the external part, I am sorry to add, has been
equally neglected; and the chapels and monuments exposed to the
wanton mischief of boys and idle people.&nbsp; The West front of
the Cathedral has very lately been repaired by a Mr. Nash, <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> who has endeavoured, with bad success,
to imitate the beautiful circular window remaining in the ruins
of the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp; The stone, likewise, with
which it is built, is of so soft a substance, that it even
moulders with the touch of the finger; but possibly it may, by
being exposed to the air, like the Bath stone, become more solid;
and, when by time it shall have acquired a darker hue, may then
better correspond with the original building.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s Palace now stands a monument of
desolation;&mdash;and as we walked over the loose fragments of
stone, which are scattered through the immense area of the
fabric, the images of former times rose to reflection,&mdash;when
the spacious hall stood proudly in their original splendour; when
the long ailes of the chapel were only responsive to the solemn,
slow-breathed chaunt.&nbsp; In this Palace is a very long room,
purposely <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>erected for the reception of King John: at the extremity
of it is a circular window, of very elegant and curious
workmanship.</p>
<p>Giraldus gives us a true description of the county round St.
Davids, representing it &ldquo;as a stony, barren, unimprovable
territory, undecked with woods, undivided by rivers, unadorned
with meadows, exposed only to wind and storms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such,
indeed, is the state and situation of St. Davids; and, the
environs having no hedges to divide the property of the farmers,
the sheep, and even the geese, are all tethered together.</p>
<p>The walk to St. David&rsquo;s Head, though barren, represents
a view striking and awful: sublimity gives place to elegance: yet
what is it to view?&mdash;a boundless waste of ocean;&mdash;not a
glimpse of smiling nature,&mdash;not a patch of vegetation, to
relieve the aching sight, or vary the objects of
admiration.&nbsp; The rocks on this shore, are shook into every
possible shape of horror; and, in many parts, resemble the
convulsions of an earthquake, splintered, shivered, and
amassed.&nbsp; On these rocks stood the famous rocking stone, or
<i>Y mean sigl</i>, which, &ldquo;though twenty yoke of oxen
could not move it, might be shaken with the slightest
touch.&rdquo;&nbsp; We understood it was thrown off its balance,
by order of the farmer, to prevent the curious from trampling on
his grounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;A mile strait West from St.
David&rsquo;s, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>betwixt Portclais and Porthmaur,&rdquo; <a
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a> is the shell of Capel Stinen, St.
Stinan&rsquo;s, or St. Justinian&rsquo;s Chapel.</p>
<p>From this spot is an extensive View of Whitsand Bay, called by
the Welsh <i>Porth Maur</i>, or the Great Bay; in which stand the
six Rocks, called <i>The Bishop and his Clerks</i>.&nbsp; Half a
league from hence is</p>
<h3>RAMSEY ISLE,</h3>
<p>half a mile long, and three quarters broad, and divided into
two considerable farms.&nbsp; The whole island is well stocked
with rabbits; and, during the Spring, the Razorbill, Puffin, and
Harry Birds, resort here in flocks.</p>
<p>Our walk, from St. Davids to</p>
<h3>FISHGUARD,</h3>
<p>afforded us little room for observation; the eye, however,
kept in view a wide range of the unbounded ocean, till, dim with
exertion, it by degrees reposed on the dark lowering rocks,
which, disregarding the angry roar of the waves, seemed to
project their broad sides, to augment the idle tumult.&nbsp;
Quitting the turnpike <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>road, in search of the place where
the French effected their landing in 1797, we passed a neat
house, called Caergwent, belonging to Mrs. Harris.&nbsp; The kind
attentions of a farmer, in the neighbourhood of this memorable
spot, claim our warmest acknowledgments.&nbsp; Having finished a
most comfortable meal at Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s house, (which,
during the confusion was considered the head-quarters of the
French, commanded by General Tate) he explained every
minuti&aelig; respecting this circumstance; and very obligingly
pointed out the situation of their camp, and related many
entertaining and interesting anecdotes.&nbsp; Deeply impressed
with gratitude towards Mr. M. for his civilities, we soon arrived
at Goodric Sands.&nbsp; This spot was very judiciously selected
by Lord Cawdor, as a proper place for the French to lay down
their arms; for, had they resisted, a cannonade of grape-shot,
from a neighbouring fortress, would have instantly played upon
them.&nbsp; Fishguard stands on a steep rock, with a convenient
harbour, formed by the river Gwain; though its situation and Bay
are interesting, it is by no means a desirable place to remain
long at.</p>
<p>Several Druidical Monuments <a name="citation56"></a><a

attention, as we drew near</p>
<h3><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>NEWPORT,</h3>
<p>Called by Giraldus Llanhever, or The Town on the River
Nevern.&nbsp; The fragments of the Castle are too insignificant
to invite the curiosity of the passing traveller: it was
demolished by Llewellyn, Prince of South-Wales, when possessed by
the Flemings.</p>
<p>The country beyond Newport presented a more pleasing
countenance; wood, water, hill, and vale, all unite, even to
induce the plodding citizen to pause, and wish to spend the
evening of his days in the vicinity of its enchantment.&nbsp; In
this interesting situation, we found the Village of
Velindre:&mdash;we here particularly observed the slaty quality
of the hills, and could not avoid condemning the folly of the
inhabitants of Velindre, in building their cottages of mud, and
sparingly covering them with straw, when Nature herself seemed to
place comforts, if not luxuries, before their view.&nbsp; But,
perhaps, these reproaches were ill-grounded: for, thus veiled in
obscurity, they were happy, as they knew not enough of the world
seriously to regret the want of these conveniencies: their
situation, indeed, seemed to verify the philosophical sentiment
of Gray;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since ignorance is bliss,<br />
&rsquo;Tis folly to be wise.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>For

<h3>KILGERRAN CASTLE,</h3>
<p>soon attracted our notice.&nbsp; The relicks of this ruin
stand on a point of rock, impending over the river Tyvi, whose
beauty time had only impaired, to heighten its grandeur.&nbsp;
Two imperfect circular towers, and the fragments of a wall, now
only remain.&nbsp; The river Tyvi, I imagine, abounds with fish,
as we observed at every door, in the village of Kilgerran, a
coracle. <a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a>&nbsp; The construction of this little
water conveyance is remarkably simple, and intended solely for
the use of fishing: a thick skin, or coarse pitched canvas, is
stretched over <i>wicker-work</i>.&nbsp; This singular
fishing-boat only conveys one man, who manages it with the
greatest adroitness imaginable; the right hand being employed in
using the paddle, the left in conducting the net, and the teeth
in holding the line.&nbsp; Two coracles generally co-operate, to
assist each other in fishing: they usually <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>measure about
five feet long, and four broad, and rounded at the corners; and,
after the labours of the day, are conveyed, on the back, to the
little cot of the fisherman, which is looked upon as a necessary
appendage to the cottage door.</p>
<p>Description can scarcely suggest the full magnificence and
beauty of the saunter from hence to Cardigan: the valley, about
two miles in extent, seemed to possess all that Nature inherits;
sloping hills, two hundred feet high, covered with wood, from the
water&rsquo;s edge, to their highest summit, and at the most
acceptable distances, and truly happy situations, interrupted by
a bold, naked, and projecting rock: whilst the broad and
translucid stream of the Tyvi reflects, as in a mirror, the
blackness of the impending shades.&nbsp; The retrospect commands
the romantic ruins of Kilgarran Castle, whose mutilated walls
close this delicious landscape.&nbsp; The whole valley bears a
strong resemblance to the situation of the celebrated
Piercefield.&nbsp; As this spot is entirely lost, by keeping the
turnpike road, it is advisable for travellers, in general, to
hire a boat from Cardigan to Kilgarran: this, our humble and
less-encumbered mode of travelling rendered unnecessary.</p>
<p>At Llechryd, not far from Kilgerran, extensive Tin-works are
carried on by Sir Benjamin Hamet.&nbsp; <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Having
already examined works of this nature at Neath, we preferred the
romantic vale of Kilgerran; as to accomplish both, would have
occupied too much time.</p>
<p>We entered the town of</p>
<h3>CARDIGAN,</h3>
<p>over a handsome stone-bridge, built over the Tyvi, which is
here of considerable width.&nbsp; In front of this stands, on a
steep eminence, the Castle, consisting chiefly of its outer
walls, which prove it to have been once a considerable
building.&nbsp; This place, considered the principal town of the
county, is called by the Britons <i>Abertuvi</i>; which name it
receives from standing near the <i>Mouth of the River
Tyvi</i>.&nbsp; It was fortified, together with the Castle, by
Gilbert, son of Richard Clare, and demolished by Rhees ap
Gryffith.</p>
<p>The town is large, and regular; its chief trade consisting in
lead, exported to Ireland.&nbsp; The Church is large, and
well-built, with a handsome tower.&nbsp; The new gaol, finished
in 1797, is conveniently situated, and appears to be a
well-planned building.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>One
mile West from Cardigan is</p>
<h3>ST. DOGMAEL&rsquo;s ABBEY,</h3>
<p>called, by Leland, <a name="citation61"></a><a
href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a> a &ldquo;Priory of
Bonhommes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Monasticon places this house amongst
the Benedictines; but it was that strict and reformed sort of
Benedictines, called the order of <i>Tiron</i>, founded by
<i>Martin of Tours</i>, who conquered the country of Cemmeis,
about the time of King William the Conqueror.&nbsp; Part of the
ruins is now converted into a chapel, for the convenience of the
vicinity.</p>
<p>At the second mile stone, in our road from Cardigan, to the
village of</p>
<h3>LLANARTH,</h3>
<p>we halted a short time, to take a retrospect of the country we
had passed.&nbsp; From this spot, the Town and Castle of
Cardigan, standing on an eminence, in the centre of a broad
valley, and encircled with hills, beautifully introduced
themselves to our view.&nbsp; From hence to</p>
<h3><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>ABERAERON,</h3>
<p>grand Sea prospects continued to enliven our
route;&mdash;whilst the faint and still fainter hues of the coast
of Ireland appeared just visibly skirting the distant
horizon.</p>
<p>Aberaeron is situated in a vale, near the conflux of the river
Aeron with the sea: from whence it receives its name; <i>Aber</i>
signifying the <i>mouth</i> of any thing.</p>
<p>The entrenchment, mentioned by Sael, in his <i>Collection of
Tours</i>, about a mile from Aberaeron, is now almost washed
away, by the daily encroachments of the sea.&nbsp; We lamented,
that the Druidical sepulchral monuments, mentioned by the same
Author, were inadvertently passed unnoticed by us.</p>
<p>In this day&rsquo;s journey, we still continued to indulge the
sublime emotions, which an unconfined view of the ocean always
inspires; a serene day, with partial gleams of sunshine, gave
magical effects to the scenery; and the sea was enlivened with
many a vessel, whose gay streamers, glittering to the sun-beams,
presented to the eye a constant moving scene, and rendered the
terrific ocean beautiful.&nbsp; Before us, the towering mountains
of Merionethshire glittered <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>in all those colours of beauty, which
constitute the sublime; and we appeared only to climb one hill,
to view still others rising in endless perspective: over the
whole was diffused the rich glow of even; and the distant
mountains were variegated by the parting tinge of lingering
day.&nbsp; A neat Church, backed by romantic hills, animated the
village of Llanrysted.&nbsp; Three miles from</p>
<h3>ABERYSTWITH,</h3>
<p>we paused at Llanryan Bridge, to admire the rich banks rising
on each side of the river Ystwith, over which this bridge is
thrown; it is built in the style of the celebrated Pont y Prydd,
in the vale of Glamorganshire.&nbsp; We entered the town of
Aberystwith, over a temporary wooden bridge. <a
name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; In the year 1796, a stone bridge
experienced the same fate with many others in Wales, occasioned
by a sudden thaw: Mr. Edwards, from Dolgelly is now engaged in
erecting another, by contract, consisting of six arches.</p>
<p>Aberystwith, partaking much of the dirt of sea-ports in
general, is situated at the termination of <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the vale of
Rhydol, in the Bay of Cardigan, and open to St. George&rsquo;s
Channel.&nbsp; The environs are stony and rugged; the coast
affords indifferent bathing, being much exposed; and the shore
rough and unpleasant.&nbsp; In fine, it is, in almost all
respects, the reverse of Tenby, except it has the advantage in
the number of houses, and, consequently, more company.&nbsp; At
the extremity of the town, upon an eminence, stand the ruins of
an ancient castle, of which little now remains but a solitary
tower, overlooking a wide expanse of sea.&nbsp; It was rendered
famous, by being, at one time, the residence of the great
Cadwalader, and in all the Welch wars considered as a fortress of
great strength: it was built by Gilbert Strongbow, 1107, and
rebuilt by Edward I. in 1277, a few years before his complete
conquest of Wales.&nbsp; The ruin of the castle now affords a
pleasant walk.</p>
<p>But what formerly rendered this town more considerable, were
the rich Lead Mines in its vicinity.&nbsp; These mines are said
to have yielded near a hundred ounces of silver from a ton of
lead, and to have produced a profit of two thousand pounds a
month.&nbsp; Sir Hugh Middleton here made the vast fortune, which
he afterwards expended on the New River, constructed for the
purpose of supplying the Northern side of London with
water.&nbsp; But Thomas Bushell raised these mines to their <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>greatest
height: an indenture was granted to him by Charles I. for the
coining of silver pieces, to be stamped with ostrich feathers, on
both sides, for the benefit of paying his workmen.&nbsp; This
gentleman was afterwards appointed Governor of Lundy Isle.&nbsp;
The most considerable lead mine was that of Bwlch-yr-Eskir-his,
discovered in 1690.&nbsp; The ore was here so near the surface,
that the moss and grass in some places just covered it.</p>
<p>Close to the scite of the old Castle, Mr. Uvedale Price, of
Foxley in Herefordshire, has erected a fantastic house, in the
castellated form, intended merely as a summer residence.&nbsp;
Mr. Nash, of Caermarthen, was the architect: it consists of three
octagon towers, with a balcony towards the sea.&nbsp; The rooms
are well contrived, and elegantly furnished: the windows command
an unlimited View of St. George&rsquo;s Channel; and the
dilapidated fragments of the Castle, are from hence viewed to
great advantage.</p>
<p>We determined to pursue the Banks of the meandering Rhyddol,
in preference to the turnpike road, in our way to Havod.</p>
<p>This valley comprehends every thing that constitutes the
beautiful; it is enclosed by high mountains on <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>each side,
vegetating to their summits; indeed, all the tints of verdure,
and diversity of foliage, here introduce themselves in one view;
the Rhyddol struggling with the huge masses of rock,&mdash;its
never-ceasing, tumultuous motion,&mdash;its sparkling
foam;&mdash;in fine, every thing that can be imagined, by the
most enthusiastic admirer of nature is blended in this short
excursion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>is not this vale</i><br />
More free from peril than the envious courts?<br />
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,<br />
The season&rsquo;s difference, as the icy fang<br />
And churlish chiding of the Winter&rsquo;s wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the inquisitive pedestrian, for this vale is inaccessible
for carriages, the old Church of Llanbadern Vawr, which signifies
<i>The Church of Great Paternus</i>, a native of Bretagne, is
particularly interesting; who, as the writer of his Life
expresses it, &ldquo;by feeding governed, and by governing fed
the Church of Ceretica.&rdquo;&nbsp; To his memory this Church,
and formerly an Episcopal See was founded: but the Bishopric, as
Roger Hovedan writes, &ldquo;early declined, because the
parishioners slew their pastor.&rdquo; <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a></p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>As we
drew near the</p>
<h3>DEVIL&rsquo;s BRIDGE,</h3>
<p>a long chain of mountains excited our admiration, encircled
half way down with a thick mist, similar in appearance to a
girdle: this circumstance seems to justify the bold imagery, and
beautiful description of a mountain given by the Poet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As some tall cliff that lifts its awful
form<br />
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm;<br />
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,<br />
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comfortable Inn, situated near this romantic spot, stands
in front of the river Rhyddol, and commanding the most
picturesque view fancy can paint, is built by the respectable and
truly hospitable owner of Havod.</p>
<p>This celebrated Bridge, so much the object of curiosity and
admiration, is so completely environed with trees, that many
travellers, not intent upon deep investigation, or in pursuit of
nature&rsquo;s landscapes, may pass over it, without the least
suspicion of the dreadful aperture, or the ancient structure,
that conveys them over <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the gulf.&nbsp; On the Eastern side
we descended a precipitous, and treacherous bank, consisting of
slate rock, or <i>laminac</i>, I should imagine, near a hundred
feet: this is the computed measurement; but the eye, confused by
the awfulness of the scene, loses its faculty of judging.&nbsp;
From this spot, the vast chine, or chasm, over which the bridge
is thrown, is seen to great advantage: the whole of this fissure
was probably occasioned by some convulsion of nature, as each
indenture seems to correspond with the opposite
protuberance.&nbsp; Under the bridge, the river Mynach, in its
confined course, meeting with obstructions of massy rock, and
fragments of prodigious size, rushes through the chasm with
irresistible violence.</p>
<p>This bridge is called in Welsh <i>Pont-ar-Fynach</i>, or
Mynach Bridge: it consists of two arches, one thrown over the
other.&nbsp; The foundation of the under one is of great
antiquity, and vulgarly attributed to the invention of the Devil:
it is supposed to have been erected as far back as the year 1087,
in the reign of William II., by the Monks of Strata Florida
Abbey, the ruins of which are still visible, about ten miles from
hence.&nbsp; Gerald mentions his passing over it, when he
accompanied Baldwin, Archbishop of Cambray, at the time of the
crusades, in the year 1188, and in the reign of Richard I.&nbsp;
The original arch being suspected to be <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>in a ruinous
condition, the present bridge was built over it, at the expence
of the county, in the year 1753.&mdash;The width of the chasm is
estimated at about thirty feet.</p>
<p>Our Ciceroni first conducted us to a fall on the river
Rhyddol, unobserved in Walker&rsquo;s <i>Description of the
Devil&rsquo;s Bridge</i>, and unnoticed by Warner.&nbsp; The
character of this fall is remarkably singular: a huge fragment of
rock, projecting over the river for a considerable way,
precipitates the water in a singular, and almost inexpressible
direction; the rocks are occasionally variegated by the dark
foliage of underwood, and sometimes barren, rugged, and
impending.</p>
<p>Description cannot suggest the full magnificence of the
prospect which spread before us, on our arrival at the grand fall
of the Mynach; for though it may paint the grandeur of the
elegance of outline, yet it cannot equal the archetypes in
nature, or draw the minute features, that reward the actual
observer, at every new choice of his position: reviewing this
thundering cataract, in the leisure of recollection, these
nervous lines of Thomson seem to describe much of the scene:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Smooth to the shelving brink a copious
flood<br />
Rolls fair and placid, where collected all<br />
In one impetuous torrent, down the steep<br />
It thundering shoots, and shakes the country round.<br />
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>At first
an azure sheet, it rushes broad;<br />
Then whitening by degrees, as prone it falls,<br />
And from the loud-resounding rocks below<br />
Dash&rsquo;d in a cloud of foam, it sends aloft<br />
A hoary mist, and forms a ceaseless shower.<br />
Nor can the tortur&rsquo;d wave here find repose:<br />
But raging still amid the shaggy rocks,<br />
Now flashes o&rsquo;er the scatter&rsquo;d fragments, now<br />
Aslant the hollow channel rapid darts;<br />
And falling fast from gradual slope to slope,<br />
With wild infracted course, and lessen&rsquo;d roar,<br />
It gains a safer bed, and steals, at last,<br />
Along the mazes of the quiet vale.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following Table, taken from Walker&rsquo;s <i>Description
of the Devil&rsquo;s Bridge</i>, gives the exact height from the
top of the bridge, to the water underneath, and the different
falls from thence, till the Mynach delivers itself into the
Rhyddol below:</p>

<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>The
rocks on each side of the fall rise perpendicularly to the height
of eight hundred feet, and finely clothed with the richest
vegetation, to its highest summit.</p>
<p>Near the bason of the first fall from the bridge we entered a
dark cavern, formerly inhabited by a set of robbers, two brothers
and a sister, called <i>Plant Mat</i>, or <i>Plant Fat</i>,
signifying Matthew&rsquo;s Children.&nbsp; Tradition reports,
that they committed various depredations in the neighbourhood,
and lived concealed in this &ldquo;<i>specus horrendum</i>&rdquo;
for many years, from the keen research of &ldquo;day&rsquo;s
garish eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The entrance just admits sufficient
light to make &ldquo;darkness visible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regret we left this romantic spot; where, if Retirement
ever had &ldquo;local habitation,&rdquo; this was her
&ldquo;place of dearest residence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;One
excursion (says Mr. Cumberland) to this place will not suffice
common observers; nor indeed many, to the lovers of the grand
sports of Nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mynach (in another place he
describes) coming down from beneath the Devil&rsquo;s Bridge, has
no equal for height or beauty that I know of; for although a
streamlet, to the famous fall of Narni in Italy, yet it rivals it
in height, and surpasses it in elegance.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;After passing deep below the bridge, as through a
narrow firth, with noises loud and ruinous, into a confined
chasm, the fleet waters pour headlong and impetuous, and leaping
from rock to rock, with fury, literally lash the mountain&rsquo;s
sides; sometimes almost imbower&rsquo;d among deep groves, and
flashing, at last, into a fan-like form, they fall rattling among
the loose stones of the Devil&rsquo;s Hole&mdash;where, to all
appearance, it shoots into a gulf beneath, and silently steals
away: for so much is carried off in spray, during the incessant
repercussions it experiences, in this long tortuous shoot, that,
in all probability, not half the water arrives at the bottom of
its profound and sullen grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four miles from hence, on the Llandiloe&rsquo;s road, is
situated</p>
<h3>HAVOD,</h3>
<p>the celebrated Seat of Mr. Johnes.&nbsp; The former, part of
the road is barren and uninteresting: but on our first entrance
into the grounds, all our past complaints were lost in
expressions of admiration.&nbsp; The mansion is a very elegant
piece of architecture built of Portland stone, and the plan
entirely novel, being a mixture of <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the Moorish and Gothic, with turrets
and painted windows.&nbsp; The whole of it indeed does great
credit to the architect, Mr. Baldwyn of Bath.&nbsp; It is
situated near the banks of the river Ystwith, and beautifully
environed by lofty hills, clothed with oak.&nbsp; The interior of
the house corresponds in elegance with the exterior.&nbsp; From
the hall we were conducted through a suite of elegant apartments,
very judiciously fitted up with paintings, statues, and antiques;
but the Library more particularly engaged our notice, containing
a choice and valuable collection of books: this octagonal room is
built in the form of a dome, with a gallery round it, supported
by a colonade of variegated marble pillars, of the ancient Doric
order, with a circular window at top, for the admission of
light.&nbsp; We entered through a handsome door, inlaid with a
large reflecting mirror; immediately opposite is another door, of
transparent plate-glass, leading to the Conservatory, three
hundred feet in length, and containing a number of curious, and
rare exotics, with a walk down the centre of the building.&nbsp;
In fine, the effect of the <i>tout ensemble</i> can better be
imagined than described.&nbsp; Amongst the other things worthy of
admiration, a handsome statue, in the Library, of Thetis dipping
Anchises in the river Styx more particularly detains
attention.&nbsp; We next passed through the Billiard-room, and
were conducted to the top of the stair-case, to admire two
elegant paintings, <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>the subjects taken from Capt. Cook&rsquo;s Voyages: the
painter is unknown.&nbsp; Many of the rooms are beautifully
furnished with rich Gobelin tapestry.</p>
<p>To give my readers a just conception of the beauties of Havod,
I shall beg leave to borrow the elegant description of it, drawn
by the masterly pen of Mr. Cumberland.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Havod,&rdquo; says Mr. Cumberland,
&ldquo;is a place in itself so pre-eminently beautiful, that it
highly merits a particular description.&nbsp; It stands
surrounded with so many noble scenes, diversified with elegance,
as well as with grandeur; the country on the approach to it is so
very wild and uncommon, and the place itself is now so
embellished by art, that it will be difficult, I believe, to
point out a spot that can be put in competition with it,
considered either as the object of the Painter&rsquo;s eye, the
Poet&rsquo;s mind, or as a desirable residence for those who,
admirers of the beautiful wildness of nature, love also to inhale
the pure air of aspiring mountains, and enjoy that <i>santo
pac&ecirc;</i> (as the Italians expressively term it,) which
arises from solitudes made social by a family circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the portico, it commands a woody, narrow, winding
vale; the undulating forms of whose ascending, <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>shaggy sides,
are richly clothed with various foliage, broken with silver
water-falls, and crowned with climbing sheep-walks, reaching to
the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither are the luxuries of life absent; for, on the
margin of the Ystwith, where it flows broadest through this
delicious vale, we see hot-houses, and a conservatory; beneath
the rocks, a bath; amid the recesses of the woods, a
flower-garden; and within the building, whose decorations, though
rich, are pure and simple, we find a mass of rare and valuable
literature, whose pages here seem doubly precious, where
meditation finds scope to range unmolested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a word, so many are the delights afforded by the
scenery of this place, and its vicinity, to a mind imbued with
any taste, that the impression on mine was increased, after an
interval of ten years from the first visit, employed chiefly in
travelling among the Alps, the Appenines, the Sabine Hills, and
the Tyrollese; along the shores of the Adriatic, over the
Glaciers of Switzerland, and up the Rhine; where, though in
search of beauty, I never, I feel, saw any thing so
fine&mdash;never so many pictures concentred in one spot; so
that, warned by the renewal of my acquaintance with them, I am
irresistibly urged to attempt <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>a description of the hitherto almost
virgin-haunts of these obscure mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wales, and its borders, both North and South, abound,
at intervals, with fine things: Piercefield has grounds of great
magnificence, and wonderfully picturesque beauty.&nbsp; Downton
Castle has a delicious woody vale, most tastefully managed;
Llangollen is brilliant; the banks of the Conway savagely grand;
Barmouth romantically rural; the great Pistill Rhayader is
horribly wild; Rhayader Wennol, gay, and gloriously
irregular&mdash;each of which merits a studied description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, at Havod, and its neighbourhood, I find the
effects of all in one circle; united with this peculiarity, that
the deep dingles, and mighty woody slopes, which from a different
source, conduct the Rhyddol&rsquo;s never-failing waters from
Plynlimmon, and the Fynach, are of an unique character, as
mountainous forests, accompanying gigantic size with graceful
forms; and, taken altogether, I see the &lsquo;sweetest
interchange of hill and valley, rivers, woods, and plains, and
falls, with forests crowned, rocks, dens, and caves;&rsquo;
insomuch, that it requires little enthusiasm there to feel
forcibly with Milton, with</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>&ldquo;All things that be, send up
from earth&rsquo;s great altar<br />
Silent praise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are four fine walks from the house, chiefly
through ways artificially made by the proprietor; all dry, kept
clean, and composed of materials found on the spot; which is
chiefly a course stone, of a greyish cast, friable in many
places, and like slate, but oftener consisting of immense masses,
that cost the miner, in making some part of these walks,
excessive labour; for there are places, where it was necessary to
perforate the rock many yards, in order to pass a promontory,
that, jutting across the way, denied further access; and to go
round which, you must have taken a great tour, and made a
fatiguing descent.&nbsp; As it is, the walks are so conducted,
that few are steep; the transitions easy, the returns commodious,
and the branches distinct.&nbsp; Neither are they too many, for
much is left for future projectors; and if a man be stout enough
to range the underwoods, and fastidious enough to reject all
trodden paths, he may, almost every where, stroll from the
studied line, till he be glad to regain the friendly conduct of
the well-known way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet one must be nice, not to be content at first to
visit the best points of view by the general routine; <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>for all that
is here done, has been to remove obstructions, reduce the
materials, and conceal the art; and we are no where presented
with attempts to force these untamed streams, or indeed to invent
any thing, where nature, the great mistress, has left all art
behind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now for many miles passed a barren, dreary country,
completely encircled with hills, and we only climbed one, to
observe still others rising in the distant perspective: not even
a house or tree appeared to interrupt the awfulness of the
mountains, which after the copious fall of rain in the night,
teemed with innumerable cataracts.&nbsp; According to our
directions, we enquired at the foot of Plinlimmon for Rhees
Morgan, as a proper man to be our conductor over the heights of
the &ldquo;fruitful father of rivers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This man being
absent, the whole family appeared thunderstruck at our
appearance, and run with all haste imaginable into their
miserable cot, or which might rather be dignified with the
appellation of a pig-stye; as that <i>filthy animal</i> seemed to
claim, with the wretched family, an equal right to a share of the
hovel.&nbsp; One apartment served for the inhabitants of every
description, with only one small hole to admit the light; the
entrance unprotected by a door, but with a blanket as a
substitute, was exposed to the pitiless blast of the
winter&rsquo;s storm.&nbsp; Reviewing this despicable <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>hovel, I
recalled to my mind a very just observation of Goldsmith&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;That one half of the world are ignorant how the other half
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ah! little think the gay licentious
proud<br />
Whom pleasure, power, and affluence surround;<br />
They, who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth,<br />
And wanton, often cruel, riot waste;<br />
Ah! little think they, while they dance along,<br />
. . . . . .<br />
. . . how many drink the cup<br />
Of baleful grief, or eat the bitter bread<br />
Of misery.&nbsp; Sore pierc&rsquo;d by wintry winds,<br />
How many shrink into the sordid hut<br />
Of cheerless poverty.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Thompson</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With some difficulty we prevailed on the female part of the
family to give us proper directions to the source of the
meandering Wye, <a name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a> and rapid Severn.&nbsp; The latter they
only understood by the name of <i>Halfren</i>, its original
British name; it is likewise called in Latin
<i>Sabrina</i>.&nbsp; From the top of Plinlimmon we, for the
first time, discovered the shaggy summit of Cader Idris, and the
spiral head of Snowdon.&nbsp; There is nothing particularly
engaging in the character of this mountain, except to its giving
rise to no less than six or eight <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>rivers, and on this account has
frequently been celebrated by the Poet.&nbsp; Though its summit
commands a circle of many miles diameter, yet the prospect by no
means answered our expectations.&nbsp; We descended into a swampy
bottom, which afforded us unpleasant walking for two or three
miles, when a most delightful and well-cultivated valley
unexpectedly enlivened our spirits.&nbsp; The sun was making</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;a golden set,<br />
And by the bright track of his fiery car<br />
Gave signal of a goodly day to-morrow,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>just as we entered this interesting vale: the hay-makers, in
the coolness of the evening, were returning to their homes,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Each by the lass he loved.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, the whole valley breathed delicious fragrance: add
to this, innumerable cataracts rushed from the mountain&rsquo;s
summits, occasioned by the late copious rains.</p>
<p>From hence a good turnpike-road soon conducted us to the
romantic town of</p>
<h3>MACHYNLLETH,</h3>
<p>considered as the center of the woollen manufactory in <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>this part of
the country, principally of the <i>strong cloth</i>, or <i>high
country cloth</i>. <a name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; The situation of Machynlleth, (or
as it is pronounced by the Welch, <i>Mahunthleth</i>) is
extremely romantic, stupendous mountains forming a natural
rampart round the town.&nbsp; We here visited the neglected
Mansion, where Owen Glendwr assembled the States of the
Principality, in 1402, and accepted from their hands the crown of
Wales.&nbsp; Part of the house is now allotted for the purpose of
a stable, the remainder is turned into a butcher&rsquo;s
shop:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Sic transit
gloria mundi</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fine, the only evident remains of its ever having been
celebrated in the annals of history, is a spacious door
way.&nbsp; The town itself, in many parts, bears the appearance
of antiquity; the streets are considerably wider than Welch towns
in general, and the market-place is well built.</p>
<p>As we entered Machynlleth, being the first town in North
Wales, we were in a manner instinctively induced to reflect on
the various incidents that had befallen us from our first
sallying forth on our pedestrian excursion.&nbsp; We took a
retrospect on all our little troubles, <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>with equally as much delight, as the
sailor, who, by the blessing of Providence, has escaped the most
imminent dangers: all our past imaginary dangers (for imaginary
evils are frequently worse than real ones) were overbalanced with
reflections on the many hours of pleasure that were flown
unheeded by: these reflections brought to my recollection some
interesting lines in Bowles&rsquo;s Sonnets, which I
involuntarily exclaimed aloud,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fair scenes ye lend a pleasure long
unknown<br />
To him who passes weary on his way;<br />
The farewell tear, which now he turns to pay<br />
Shall thank you; and whene&rsquo;er of pleasures flown,<br />
His heart some long-lost image would renew,<br />
Delightful haunts! he will remember you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sublimity of the walk from hence to <i>Talylyn</i>,
literally &ldquo;beggars description.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having crossed
a bridge of eight arches, thrown over the river Dovey, high
mountains closed us on every side, shook into every possible form
of horror; huge masses of rock hung over the road, and it seemed
necessary to remember their firm basis, to soften the terror they
inspired; whilst other mishapen fragments lie scattered at the
side of the road.&nbsp; The transparent Dyflas, whose clear
surface reflected the tremulous picture in all its colours, forms
one continued cataract for five or six <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>miles, overflowing with the
innumerable tributary torrents, which hurry themselves down from
the highest summit of the surrounding rocks; whilst to give
effect to the whole prospect, the shaggy head of Cader Idris
towers the majestic sentinel of the scene, whose &ldquo;cloud
cap&rsquo;d&rdquo; summit the eye aches in surveying.&nbsp; To
our great disappointment, the weather prevented our ascending
this celebrated mountain giant.&nbsp; Cader Idris is esteemed, in
height, the second mountain in all Wales, rising two thousand
eight hundred and fifty feet above the green of Dolgelly. <a
name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a></p>
<p>If the weather proves favourable to ascend Cader Idris,
travellers may be very comfortably accommodated with beds at</p>
<h3>TALYLYN;</h3>
<p>a small village, situated at the foot of the mountain; and
where they will likewise meet with a conductor, in every respect
suited for this Alpine excursion.&nbsp; Mr. Jones, the landlord
of the Blue Lion, used all his influence to persuade us, by
largely expatiating on the comforts of his accommodations, to
detain us till the <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>weather wore a more favourable aspect, but knowing the
uncertainty of his conjectures, we determined to make Barmouth
our head quarters.&nbsp; Quitting therefore our officiously
polite landlord, we soon arrived at the Pool of Three Grains,
which, though of inferior size, yet is generally credited to be
unfathomable; it abounds in fish, and derives its name from three
immense stones, or rather fragments of rock near it, which the
common people confidently assert, and believe, the giant Idris
took out of his shoes as he passed this pool.</p>
<p>Having ascended several hills, a quick descent of three or
four miles, soon brought us to</p>
<h3>DOLGELLY;</h3>
<p>surrounded with &ldquo;a tempestuous sea of mountains,&rdquo;
and watered by the rapid current of the river Avonvawr, over
which is thrown a large and handsome stone bridge, at the
entrance of the town.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of this romantic spot, and indeed in many
parts of Merionethshire, the manufacture of strong cloth has long
been carried on. <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a></p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>We were
reluctantly necessitated to leave this interesting town of
Dolgelly, much sooner than we wished, had we obeyed our own
inclinations.&nbsp; No one can picture to themselves a more
picturesque situation than that of Dolgelly:&mdash;an enclosed
vale, encircled with the craggy and subject mountains of Cader
Idris, forming an amphitheatre,&mdash;watered by the Alpine
torrent of the Maw,&mdash;and richly clothed with wood.&nbsp; But
necessity has no law; the best Inn was pre-occupied, and no
comfortable accommodations could be found, and though drenched
with rain, we were compelled to quicken our pace to the
well-known bathing place of</p>
<h3>BARMOUTH.</h3>
<p>It is advisable for all travellers, pedestrians not excepted,
to leave Dolgelly at high water, as without that, the scenery
loses much of its beauty; if convenient, it is certainly
preferable to hire a boat, at the Stoves; the charge is three
shillings and sixpence; by this you will save a walk of eight
miles, and both from <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>your situation, and from being more
at your ease, will better admit of your observing the surrounding
scenery, with which you cannot fail to be highly gratified.</p>
<p>This short excursion of eight miles, is truly grand, awful,
and sublime; and though many parts of this striking valley are
richly cultivated, yet, by the side of the road, enormous
mountains, formed into the most capricious shapes, shoot into the
clouds, and sometimes projecting so far over the road, as seeming
to impede our farther progress: the wide expanse of the ocean, in
front, with the arm of the sea running up the country in the
centre of the valley; in fine, the <i>tout ensemble</i> claimed
our highest admiration.</p>
<p>Barmouth, though considered as a bathing-place, is very
inferior to Tenby, yet its situation for grandeur of rocks, has
been frequently compared, by many Tourists, to Gibraltar; and by
others, esteemed not unlike St. Kitts, in the West Indies.&nbsp;
The vast sand banks, formed by the tides immediately in front of
the town, are the only barriers which protect it from the
inundations of the sea.&nbsp; The shore is extremely level, and
affords, for many miles, excellent riding.&nbsp; In respect to
the bathing, little can be said to recommend it; the machines are
not drawn into the water, and by this palpable inconvenience, you
are under the disagreeable <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>necessity of walking a considerable
way in, before the water is sufficiently deep for &ldquo;plunging
headlong in the briny flood.&rdquo;&nbsp; During our stay here,
two gentlemen perceiving that the water was very much alloyed by
a fresh water stream disemboguing itself into the sea, at
Barmouth, persuaded Mrs. Lewis, the obliging landlady of the
Cors-y-gedol Arms, to remove the machines farther from the town;
and from them we were informed, that though the salt water was
purer, yet they found it impossible to draw them sufficiently
deep for good bathing: the machines being stationary on the
sands, the ladies likewise find it remarkably inconvenient, being
equally compelled to walk in.&nbsp; The folly of this method
seems to be more striking, as the objection might be so easily
obviated.&nbsp; The lower class here, as in many other parts of
Wales, indiscriminately dress and undress on the sands, and pay
very little distinction to their sex.</p>
<p>The board and lodging is regulated on the same excellent plan
here as at Tenby, with very little difference in respect to the
expence.&nbsp; The town itself is very dirty, and so irregularly
built, on the declivity of a rock, that the windows of one house
not uncommonly look down on the neighbouring chimney.&nbsp; We
could not avoid observing the number of pigs, which are esteemed
in this part of the country far superior to <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>any in
England, lying in every corner of the street; and these pigs, I
rather imagine, consider themselves, during the night, inmates of
the peasant&rsquo;s cottage: yet these hardships, if they may be
distinguished by that name, the inhabitants of the hovel suffer
without complaint, and deem themselves perfectly happy as long as
they possess a pile of turf to keep off the inclemency of the
winter&rsquo;s blast, a small strip of ground, well stocked with
potatoes, some poultry, and a fat pig; though one hovel protects
them all.&nbsp; Though to appearance, their situation is most
miserable, yet it has no effect on their tempers and
dispositions; their hospitality, and indeed kindness, towards
strangers in distress, is an interesting trait in their
character: to instance this, I am induced to mention an anecdote,
which took place at Hubberstone, not long ago.&nbsp; A lady
anxiously waiting the arrival of her husband, from Ireland, at
the miserable village of Hubberstone, soon interested even the
meaner inhabitants of the place in her behalf; who willing to
render her situation as comfortable as possible, seemed to vie
with each other in producing the most delicious fruits, and the
choicest garlands of flowers, to present them to the unhappy
consort; and not content alone with this, she was generally
greeted in the streets, with the phrase, &ldquo;There goes poor
Mrs. L&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady, at last, impatient for the
arrival of her husband, determined to sail for Ireland.&nbsp; <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>The
faithfulness of the little group that accompanied her to the
shore, can better be imagined than described; the last farewell,
with tears of artless innocence, and the beseeching that
Providence &ldquo;who governs the waves, and stills the raging of
the sea,&rdquo; to grant her a prosperous voyage; all this seemed
to come so thoroughly from the bottom of their hearts, that we
cannot avoid feeling ourselves interested in their behalf.</p>
<p>The road from hence to</p>
<h3>HARLECH,</h3>
<p>is stony and uninteresting; to the left an unbounded view of
the wide ocean, and in front, the steep mountains of North Wales
rose in endless perspective.&nbsp; About four miles from
Barmouth, we passed the two lodges at Tal-y-bont, leading to
Cors-y-gedol, the seat of Sir Thomas Mostyn.&nbsp; It is
practicable to go by the sands, but we were given to understand,
by Mrs. Lewis, that the turnpike was, if any thing, shorter, the
scenery more pleasing, and the guides necessary for crossing
those dangerous sands, in general, most complete villains.</p>
<p>Harlech, though formed by Edward I. into a borough, can now be
esteemed little more than a dirty <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>village: the present castle, one of
the most entire in Wales, is founded on a very high rock,
projecting in the Irish Sea, and defended by a deep foss on the
east side; below it is a marsh of considerable extent,
occasionally overflowed by the sea; from the top of the walls to
this marsh the height is very considerable, and from thence the
Bay of Cardigan is seen to great advantage; in addition to this,
the shagged summits of Cader Buchan and Snowdon, in
Caernarvonshire, being enveloped in clouds, appear scarcely
visible.</p>
<p>At the public-house, we accidentally met with a well-informed
man, who minutely delineated every part of the castle; beginning
with the founder, in the true characteristic style of a Welchman,
run through his pedigree several generations: this, however, did
not interest us, cursory pedestrians; and with little persuasion
we soon induced him to write down, in as concise a manner as
possible, any information he was acquainted with respecting the
castle: &ldquo;The founder of Harlech Castle, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 552, was Maclegwynn; Gwynead made
Caer Dugoll (Shrewsbury;) Caer Gyffin (Aber Conway;) Caer Gollwyn
(Harleck) supposed to be buried in Cirester, and reigned
thirty-four years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether this information is
correct, I will not take upon me to assert; but meeting with a
Welchman, in this part of the country, capable of <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>writing,
rather surprised us, and induced me to transcribe this short
paragraph.</p>
<p>The double gate-way, with four strong towers, is still very
perfect; and the whole in sufficient repair, to form a conjecture
of its ancient extent and grandeur.&nbsp; It was originally
supposed to have been a Roman town, a conjecture founded on the
great number of coins, and other pieces of antiquity, which have
been found here, and in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In 1408 it was taken by the Earl of Pembroke; and afforded
likewise shelter to Margaret of Anjour, after the battle of
Northampton, 1460, and was the last in North-Wales, which held
out for the King, being surrendered to General Mytton, 1647.</p>
<p>In a garden near this castle was dug up, in the year 1692, an
ancient golden torques, of a round form, an inch in
circumference, and weighing eight ounces.&nbsp; This curious
relick of British antiquity, exhibited in a drawing by Mr.
Pennant, still continues in the possession of the Mostyn
family.&nbsp; As we had not an opportunity of examining the
original, this account can only be gathered from the information
of former authors, who represent it, as &ldquo;a wreathed bar, or
rather three or four rods twisted together, about four <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>feet long,
flexible, but bending naturally only one way, in form of a
hat-band: it originally had holes at each end, not twitted or
sharp, but plain, and cut even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1694, the prodigious phenomenon of fire, or kindled
exhalation, which disturbed the inhabitants of this
neighbourhood, is both singular and extraordinary; sixteen ricks
of hay, and two barns, were burnt by a kindled exhalation, or
blue weak flame, proceeding from the sea: this lasted about a
fortnight or three weeks, poisoning the grass, and firing it for
the space of a mile.&nbsp; It is extraordinary, that it had no
effect on the men, who interposed their endeavours to save the
ricks from destruction, even by running into it.&nbsp; For a more
accurate account of this singular phenomenon, I refer my readers
to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, No. 208, and likewise
to the Addenda, in Cambden: suffice it to say, that the air and
grass was so infected, that it occasioned a great mortality of
cattle, horses, sheep, and goats.&nbsp; The various conjectures
that have been formed, to account for this kindled exhalation,
seem to be very unsatisfactory; something similar to this, both
in the appearance and in the effect, happened in France in the
year 1734.</p>
<p>As, from the unfavourableness of the weather, we <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>had not
contemplated the rich scenery between Barmouth and Dolgelly, with
that nice investigation which it deserved, we determined, by
again returning to our obliging landlady at the Cors-y-gedol
Arms, to seize the opportunity of again admiring its beauties;
and, by taking a more circuitous route to the Vale of Festiniog,
pay that attention to the Falls of Doll-y-mullin, Moddach, and
Caen, which they so deservedly require.</p>
<p>This second saunter we found by no means tedious: the scene
seemed perpetually changing at every unexpected curvature of the
road; and the rude features of the mountains appeared to assume
new forms, as the winding presented them to the eye in different
attitudes, whilst the shifting vapours, which partially concealed
their minuter grandeur, assisted the illusions of the
sight.&nbsp; Amidst new woods, rising in the majesty of foliage,
the scattered cottage, with its bluish smoke curling high in the
air, was frequently rendered interesting by its neat simplicity:
and served to constitute the romantic beauties of this
picturesque saunter.</p>
<p>This pleasing scenery varied little till we arrived within two
miles of Dolgelly, when several gentlemens&rsquo; seats burst
upon our sight; and leaving that enchanting spot to the left, at
the Laneltyd turnpike, a different object <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>presented
itself to our view.&nbsp; For four miles we walked by the side of
a hill, the most translucent stream attending us the whole way;
for though the road was situated so much above it, yet the sandy
bottom, with the finny tribe, in considerable numbers, sporting
in this transparent element, were easily descried.&nbsp; On each
side, the mountains rose to a considerable height, with the
craggy summit of Cader Idris claiming the pre-eminence.&nbsp; We
soon arrived at the small ale-house (Traveller&rsquo;s Rest)
where we met the labourer of Mr. Madox, whom we were recommended
to enquire for, as a proper ciceroni to the water-falls in his
vicinity.&nbsp; Having finished our scanty but wholesome repast,
we repaired with an old woman, the labourer being confined to the
house by indisposition, to the fall of Doll-y-mullin.&nbsp; There
appeared to be something singular in the appearance of this
&ldquo;mountain elf;&rdquo; destitute of shoes and stockings, in
the true Cambrian stile, she trip&rsquo;d it, occasionally
singing, and sometimes discontented with the world, herself, and
every thing, uttering a most dismal groan.&nbsp; This excited our
curiosity; but to learn much of her situation we soon found
impracticable; her knowledge of the English language was very
trivial; and as she seemed not much inclined to give us any
information respecting the adjacent country, we found it useless
to make enquiries concerning her condition in life.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Our
surly conductress first led us through Mr. Madox&rsquo;s grounds;
to the left of the Tan-y-bwlch road, by a most delightful walk
cut through the wood, we now soon reached the falls of
Doll-y-mullin, the roaring of which had a long time announced its
vicinity.&nbsp; This cataract, though considered only as a
prelude to the grand falls of the Cayne and Moddach, is still
worthy the attention of the passing traveller; for though the
river precipitates itself not more than fifty feet, yet the
projection and situation of the rocks, and the thick oak,
carelessly throwing its broad brown arms across the troubled
waters, is singularly pleasing.&nbsp; We had hitherto only
contemplated this scene from the foot of the fall; but how noble
the effect, when we began to wind up the steep ascent, and paused
at every bason, which the water had formed in the excavated
rock.</p>
<p>By a retrograde saunter we soon gained the Tan-y-bwlch road,
and passing over the romantic bridge of Pont ar Garfa,
beautifully entwined with the rich drapery of ivy, we ascended a
steep path over the slaty mountain of Tylyn Gwladys, two miles in
extent.&mdash;Sublimity, indeed, gave place to elegance; behind
us, the huge steeps of Cader Idris, lifting high above the
rolling clouds its shaggy head, of which at intervals, we caught
a glance through the thick mist which enveloped it; in front
Snowdon, conscious of pre-eminence, <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>rose in the distant perspective;
these were the boundaries of our view.&nbsp; On the opposite side
a barren mountain, dignified by the name of Prince of Wales,
appeared scarcely accessible, but to the steps of the enthusiast;
this formerly afforded a vast quantity of ore, but it has lately
so much failed, as not to produce even a sufficiency to
remunerate the miners.&nbsp; While traversing these barren
mountains, it is not less singular than interesting, occasionally
to meet the most delicious vallies, watered by some foaming
river; these literally surcharged</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With weighted rains, and melted Alpine
snows.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the true characteristic of the Welch scenery: the
finest verdure, and the most enchanting vallies are discovered in
the bosom of sterility, where natural cascades, precipitating
themselves from their rude pinnacles, alone disturb the silence
which reigns in that asylum, only to render it more enchanting to
the inquisitive pedestrians, for these landscapes are only
accessible to their steps: the distant swell of the cataract had
now long proclaimed our proximity to the object in pursuit.&nbsp;
The falls of the Cayne and the Moddach are at no great distance
from one another, being only separated by a thick wood.&nbsp;
Crossing a small bridge, above fifty feet from the water, formed
only by the trunk of an oak, which has accidentally fallen across
the rapid torrent; <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>our conductress very judiciously selected the latter as
the first object for our admiration.&nbsp; The computed
measurement of this fall is estimated between seventy and eighty
feet, dividing itself into three distinct parts, each finely
broken by the projected rocks: the quantity of water is very
inconsiderable; but the whole is admirably presented to the eye
in one view.&nbsp; The first fall, about twenty feet,
precipitates itself into a deep pool, thirty feet diameter; from
thence over a second ledge, thirty feet high; and, lastly, it
discharges itself into a pool of considerable dimensions.&nbsp;
The declivities of the rocks are luxuriantly clothed with wood;
the oak more particularly spreading its gigantic arms across the
foaming torrent: a variety of trees, indeed, profusely embellish
the whole of this glen, which are finely contrasted with the dark
brown rocks; constituting so finished a picture, and representing
such a variety of colours, that their beauties the imagination
can better conceive, than the pen describe.</p>
<p>We now returned to the fall of the Cayne, infinitely superior
to any in Wales, being two hundred feet perpendicular,
uninterrupted by rocks, and not intercepted by the thick wood
which encircles it.&nbsp; For a considerable time we both of us
gazed with that wrapt admiration, which loathes to be disturbed
by the mutual exchange of our ideas; and stunned with the
continual <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>uproar, and never-ceasing tumultuous motion of the
sparkling foam, we silently admired the grandeur of the
landscape.&nbsp; On each side the horrific crags seemed to bid
defiance to the goat&rsquo;s activity.&nbsp; The Cayne, after
this stunning cataract, throws its troubled waters over a rocky
bed, till it unites itself with the Moddach below.</p>
<p>With reluctance we left this romantic situation; and,
according to the directions of our conductress, soon found
ourselves in the turnpike road to Tan-y-bwlch, understanding that
Mr. Warner&rsquo;s route to Pen-street afforded indifferent
walking.&nbsp; Stupendous mountains attended us some way; and, to
borrow a description from a celebrated author, they &ldquo;looked
like the rude materials of creation, forming the barrier of
unwrought space.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sun was now making a
&ldquo;golden set;&rdquo; the mountains were thrown together in
noble masses, appearing to scale the heavens, to intercept its
rays, and emulous to receive the parting tinge of lingering
day.&nbsp; We were watching with admiration the mild splendour of
its light, fading from the distant landscape, when we perceived
the rich vale of Festiniog suddenly open itself to our view: we
observed the busy group of haymakers, who had completed their
day&rsquo;s labour, returning to their homes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>&ldquo;While heard from dale to
dale,<br />
Waking the breeze, resounds the blended voice<br />
Of happy labour, love and social glee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pleased with this rustic scene, we caught the cheerful song,
which was wafted on the gentle breeze.&nbsp; With pleasure we
anticipated a saunter through this vale, early the ensuing
morning; for one tint of sober gray had now covered its various
coloured features, and the sun had now gleamed its last light
upon the rivulet which winds through the bottom.</p>
<h3>TAN-Y-BWLCH.</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;rich-hair&rsquo;d youth of morn&rdquo; had not long
left its saffron bed, and the very air was balmy as it freshened
into morn, when we hurried from our Inn to enjoy the luxuries of
the Vale of Festiniog, so well celebrated by the pen of Lord
Littleton.&nbsp; &ldquo;With the woman one loves, with the friend
of one&rsquo;s heart, (says his Lordship) and a good study of
books, one may pass an age there, and think it a day.&nbsp; If
one has a mind to live long, and renew his youth, let him come
and settle at Festiniog.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are the sentiments of
Lord Littleton, in which seemed to be verified the situation of
Mr. Oakley, who has selected this spot for his residence.&nbsp;
Tan-y-bwlch Hall, (for <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>by that name is Mr. Oakley&rsquo;s
Seat dignified) is environed by a thick wood, which climbs the
steep mountains behind his mansion.&nbsp; We followed the
meandering and translucent waters of the river Dryryd, till we
arrived at the Village of Maentwrog, situated about the middle of
this Paradise.&nbsp; Passing through the village, we observed a
small but neat cottage, which was rendered interesting to the
way-farer by its neat simplicity.&nbsp; Perceiving a stand of
fruit at the door, we were enticed to enter the cottage, where we
found the interior of the house as comfortable, as the situation
was interesting.&nbsp; A large old-fashioned chimney corner, with
benches to receive a social party, formed a most enviable retreat
from the rude storms of winter, and defied alike the weather and
the world:&mdash;with what pleasure did I picture,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A smiling circle, emulous to
please,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gathering round a blazing pile of wood on the hearth, free
from all the vicissitudes and cares of the world, happy in their
own home, blessed in the sweet affections of kindred amity,
regardless of the winter blast that struggled against the window,
and the snow that pelted against the roof.&nbsp; On our entering,
the wife who possessed &ldquo;the home of happiness, an honest
breast,&rdquo; invited us &ldquo;to take a seat&rdquo; under the
window, which overlooking the village, and the dark <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>tower of
the church, offered the delights of other seasons.&nbsp; The
sweets of a little garden, joined its fragrance to the
honeysuckle, which enwreathed with rich drapery the windows; and
here too lay the old family Bible, which had been put aside on
our first entrance; we regretted, not having an opportunity of
seeing the husband, whom, I make no doubt</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Envied not, and never thought of kings,<br
/>
Nor from those appetites sustain&rsquo;d annoy,<br />
That chance may frustrate, or indulgence cloy;<br />
Each season look&rsquo;d delightful as it past,<br />
To the fond husband, and the faithful wife.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our intended route for this day being very short, we did not
leave Tan-y-bwlch till after breakfast, and even then lingered
through the valley, to take one last adieu of this paradisiacal
spot; the Dryryd serpentizing through the meadows, and the lively
green of the swelling declivities on each side, beautifully
contrasted with the ripening corn.&nbsp; From the vast quantity
of ore we discovered, I am inclined to believe, that any spirited
speculator would find it amply repay him for the expences and
labour attending his speculations.&nbsp; The vale of Festiniog,
not exceeding three miles long, and one in breadth, is a very
rich tract of land.</p>
<p>An extremely rough, rocky, and unpleasant road, <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>with
nothing to engage our attention; and the country uncultivated,
and diverted of every thing that gives, even the shadow of
civilization, brought us to the far-famed Pont Aber-glaslyn, or,
<i>The Bridge of the Harbour of the Blue Lake</i>; and not
uncommonly styled, the <i>Devil&rsquo;s Bridge</i>.&nbsp; This
last appellation has very frequently misled strangers, who,
confounding it with the well-known bridge at Havod, have been
much disappointed, their expectations being raised very high,
from the general descriptions of that place.&nbsp; Of this,
indeed, we found an instance on the very spot.&nbsp; This bridge
connects the two counties of Merionethshire and Caernarvonshire;
being, from the parapet to the water, forty feet.&nbsp; From the
description of former tourists, it did not answer our
expectations; but the salmon-leap is an interesting object from
the bridge: the height is about fifteen feet; and though we
observed very many attempt this surprising feat of agility, not
one succeeded.&nbsp; Some fishermen below soon excited our
curiosity, and salmon was here offered for sale at three-pence
per pound.</p>
<p>An intelligent man here offered himself as our guide to the
rich Copper-mines, in the vicinity of Pont Aber-Glaslyn.&nbsp;
This miner, having worked both here and at the Paris mountain,
confidently asserted, that one pound of this ore was now esteemed
equivalent to twice the quantity, produced in Anglesea.&nbsp;
Stupendous <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>cliffs, by the road side, literally rise eight hundred
and sixty feet perpendicularly, and hang in the most capricious
forms over the torrent, which, straggling amongst the recesses of
stone, is hastening forward to disembogue itself into the estuary
of Traeth Mawr.&nbsp; The pass is not more than seventy feet;
after much rain it is entirely inundated by the overflowings of
the Glaslyn, which reflected, as in a mirror, the blackness of
the impending cliffs.&nbsp; On the Caernarvonshire side are
several lead mines; but they have not proved sufficiently rich,
to reward the labour of working.</p>
<p>The situation of our Inn at</p>
<h3>BEDDGELERT,</h3>
<p>is very romantic, and would form an interesting drawing, by
taking in a small bridge of two arches below the house.&nbsp; It
is completely encircled by lofty mountains, which may be
considered as subject to the &ldquo;cloud-capt
Snowdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How often has the idea of this stupendous mountain filled my
heart with enthusiastic rapture!&nbsp; Every time I cast my eyes
on that solemn, that majestic vision, it is not without the most
powerful emotion; it excites that <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>tender melancholy, which exalts,
rather than depresses the mind!&nbsp; How delightful, to bid
adieu to all the cares and occupations of the world, for the
reflection of those scenes of sublimity and grandeur, which forms
such contrast to the transientness of sublunary greatness!&nbsp;
With what anxiety have we watched the setting sun, loitering just
below the horizon, and illuminating the highest summit of Snowdon
with a golden tinge, and we still watch the passing clouds of
night, fearing lest the morning should prove unfavourable for our
Alpine excursion.</p>
<h3>SNOWDON.</h3>
<p>We engaged the Miner, as our Conductor over the mountain, who
entertained us much with displaying, in strong colours, the
tricks and impositions of his brother guides, and more
particularly of the methodistical Landlord of our Inn, who is
generally employed on these occasions.&nbsp; His pride too is not
a little elevated, by having conducted <i>The Great Doctor</i> to
its highest summit; this seemingly ridiculous phrase for some
time puzzled us; but we have since found out, that our guide was
talking of no less a man, than the present respectable and
learned Dean of Christchurch, who <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>ascended this mountain last
year.&nbsp; Though our guide <a name="citation105"></a><a
href="#footnote105" class="citation">[105]</a> was pompous, and
rather too partial to the marvellous, yet I strenuously recommend
him to all tourists.</p>
<p>At half past twelve, we started from our Inn, determined to
see the sun rise from its highest summit.&nbsp; The night was now
very dark, and we could just discover, that the top of Snowdon
was entirely enveloped in a thick, impenetrable mist: this
unpropitious omen staggered our resolutions; and we for some time
hesitated respecting our farther progress; but our guide assuring
us, that his <i>comfortable</i> cottage was not far distant, we
again plucked up resolution; and quitting the highway about two
miles on the Caernarvon road, we turned to the right, through a
boggy unpleasant land, and in danger of losing our shoes every
step we took.&nbsp; This soon brought us to the <i>comfortable
cot</i>, the filth and dirtiness of which can better be imagined
than described; a worm-eaten bed, two small stools, and a table
fixed to the wall, composed the whole of his furniture,&mdash;two
fighting cocks were perched on a beam, which Thomas seemed to
pride himself in the possession of; the smoke of the fire
ascended through a small hole in the roof of this <i>comfortable
mansion</i>, the door of which did not appear <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>proof
against the &ldquo;churlish chiding of the winter
blast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such, indeed, was the situation of this Cambrian mountaineer;
and though, in our own opinion, misery, poverty, and dirt
personified, seemed to be the real inhabitants of this cottage,
yet there was something prepossessing in his character; for
frequently, with the greatest vehemence imaginable, and in the
true stile of an anchorite, he declared, that &ldquo;though he
boasted not riches, yet he boasted of independence; and though he
possessed not wealth, yet he possessed the home of happiness, an
honest breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning appearing to wear a more favourable aspect, we
again sallied forth; the bogs, however, still rendered it
extremely unpleasant.&nbsp; But this inconvenience was only
temporary: we soon came to a part of the mountain, entirely
composed of loose stones, and fragments of rock, which, by
affording a very treacherous footing, you are liable to perpetual
falls.&nbsp; The mountain now became much steeper, the path less
rocky, and our mountaineer, the higher we proceeded, more induced
to exhibit feats of his agility, by occasionally running down a
short precipice, and then, by a loud shout or vociferation,
shewing us the obedience of the sheep, who instantaneously
flocked round him, at the <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>sound of his voice: it is singular,
the caution implanted in this animal, by instinct, for the mutual
protection of each other; from the liberty they enjoy, they
seldom congregate in one flock, but are generally discovered
grazing in parties from six to a dozen, one of which is regularly
appointed centinel, to watch the motions of their inveterate
enemies (foxes and birds of prey), which infest this
mountain.&nbsp; A wider expanse of the hemisphere disclosed
itself, and every object below us gradually diminished, as we
ascended.&nbsp; The freshness of the mountain <i>whetted</i> our
appetites; and our conductor, with very little persuasion, soon
influenced us to open our little basket of provisions.&nbsp; The
sun, the &ldquo;rich-hair&rsquo;d youth of morn,&rdquo; was just
peeping from its bed; and having refreshed ourselves, with eager
impatience we again climbed the rugged precipice, for we had
still a considerable height to ascend.&nbsp; We now descended
several steep declivities, by a narrow path, not more than three
yards wide, with a dreadful perpendicular on each side, the sight
of which almost turned us giddy.&nbsp; As we were passing this
hazardous path, a thick mist enveloped us, and an impenetrable
abyss appeared on both sides; the effect, indeed, can scarcely be
conceived; our footing to us, puisne mountaineers, seemed very
insecure; and a total destruction would have been the consequence
of one false step.&nbsp; The air grew intensely cold, and by our
guide&rsquo;s recommendation, <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>we a second time produced our pistol
of rum, diluted with milk; but this cordial must be used with
caution, as a very small quantity of strong liquor affects the
head, owing to the rarification of the air.&nbsp; On our reaching
the summit, all our difficulties were forgotten, and our
imaginary complaints overborne with exclamations of wonder,
surprise, and admiration.&nbsp; The light thin misty cloud, which
had for some time enveloped us, as if by enchantment, suddenly
dispersed; the whole ocean appeared illuminated by a fiery
substance, and all the subject hills below us, for they resembled
<i>mole-hills</i>, were gradually tinged by the rich glow of the
sun; whose orb, becoming at length distinctly visible, displayed
the whole island of Anglesea so distinctly, that we descried, as
in map, its flat and uncultivated plains, bounded by the rich and
inexhaustible Paris Mountains, in the vicinity of Holyhead.&nbsp;
The point on which we were standing, did not exceed a square of
five yards, and we sickened almost at the sight of the steep
precipices which environed us; round it is a small parapet,
formed by the customary tribute of all strangers, who visit this
summit, and to which we likewise contributed, by placing a large
stone on its top: this parapet, indeed, sheltered us from the
chilly cold, and protected us from the piercing wind, which this
height must naturally be exposed to.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>We
remained in this situation for a considerable time, and
endeavoured, without success, to enumerate the several lakes,
forest, woods, and counties, which were exposed to us in one
view; but, lost and confounded with the innumerable objects
worthy of admiration, and regardless of the chilling cold, we
took a distinct survey of the Isle of Man, together with a faint
prospect of the highlands in Ireland, which appeared just visibly
skirting the distant horizon; but another object soon engrossed
all our attention;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wide, the unbounded prospects lay
before us;<br />
But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it:&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For we unexpectedly observed long billows of vapour tossing
about, half way down the mountain, totally excluding the country
below, and occasionally dispersing, and partially revealing, its
features, while above, the azure expanse of the heavens remained
un-obscured by the thinnest mist.&nbsp; This, however, was of no
long continuance: a thick cloud presently wet us through; and the
point on which we were standing could alone be
distinguished.&nbsp; As there appeared little or no chance of the
clouds dispersing, we soon commenced our
descent.&mdash;Respecting this Alpine excursion, suffice it to
say, that though our expectations were raised exceedingly high,
it infinitely surpassed all conception, and baffled all
description; for no colour of <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>language can paint the grandeur of
the rising sun, observed from this eminence, or describe the
lakes, woods, and forests, which are extended before you; for
description, though it enumerates their names, yet it cannot draw
the elegance of outline, cannot give the effect of precipices, or
delineate the minute features, which reward the actual observer,
at every new choice of his position, and by changing their colour
and form in his gradual ascent, till at last every object
dwindles into atoms: in short, this interesting excursion, which
comprehends every thing that is awful, grand, and sublime,
producing the most pleasing sensations, has left traces in the
memory, which the imagination will ever hold dear.</p>
<p>Various have been the conjectures on the definition of this
mountain; some authors affirm, that the Welch name of Snowdon
signifies the <i>Eagle&rsquo;s Rocks</i>, deducing it from the
number of those birds that formerly haunted these rocks; but the
most simple conjecture seems to be, that this name alludes to the
frequency of the snow on the highest peaks.&nbsp; This
mountainous tract was formerly celebrated for its fertility and
woods; and Leland affirms, that all Crigereri was forest.&nbsp;
It now yields no corn; and its produce consists in cattle and
black sheep, with large flocks of goats.&nbsp; &ldquo;Its height
(says Pennant) has been variously reported.&nbsp; Mr. Caswell, <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>who was
employed by Mr. Adams, in a survey of Wales, 1682, measured it by
instruments, made by the direction of Mr. Flamstead, and asserts
it to have been one thousand two hundred and forty.&nbsp; Mr.
Lluyd says, its perpendicular height is about one thousand three
hundred yards above the sea level; but later experiments have
ascertained it at one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine yards,
reckoning from the quay at Caernarvon, to the highest
peak.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ascent is computed three miles; the
extremity, or summit, three quarters of a mile
perpendicular.&nbsp; By the inhabitants of the country it is
called Moel-y-Wydva, <i>i.e.</i> <i>The Conspicuous Hill</i>; and
sometimes Krag Ey reri; and in the old English maps it is always
spelt <i>Snawdon</i>.&nbsp; The lakes in this tract amount to a
considerable number, and abound with trout, eels, gwyniadd, and
some of them well-stored with char.&nbsp; The most noted peaks of
this mountain are distinguished by the names Moel-y-Wydva,
y-Glyder, Karmedh Dhavidh, and Karmedh Llewelyn.&mdash;These
hills are, in a manner, heaped on one another, near the summit;
and we only climbed one rock, to see three or four more; between
each is a <i>cwm</i>, or valley, generally with a lake.&nbsp; We
made particular enquiries concerning y-Glyder-Bach, and found
that the description of it is by no means exaggerated.&nbsp;
Several columnar stones, of enormous size, formed into the most
fantastical shapes, and lying in several directions, <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>with many
of their tops crowned with stones, placed horizontally on
them.&nbsp; One we observed rocked with the slightest
touch.&nbsp; In the fissures of the rock, <i>cubic
pyrit&aelig;</i>, are not uncommonly found; the <i>saxifraga
nivalis</i>, and the species called by Linn&aelig;us
<i>&aelig;thereal</i>, in great abundance.</p>
<p>The first two miles of our descent, we by no means found
difficult, but wishing to take a minute survey of the picturesque
pass of Llanberris, we changed the route generally prescribed to
strangers, and descended a rugged and almost perpendicular path,
in opposition to the proposals of our guide, who strenuously
endeavoured to dissuade us from the attempt, alleging the
difficulty of the steep, and relating a melancholy story of a
gentleman, who many years back had broken his leg.&nbsp; This had
no effect.&nbsp; We determined to proceed; and the vale of
Llanberris amply rewarded us for the trouble.&nbsp; It is bounded
by the steep precipices of Snowdon, and two large lakes,
communicating by a river.&nbsp; It was formerly a large forest,
but the woods are now entirely cut down.&nbsp; We here dismissed
our Cambrian mountaineer, and easily found our way to Dolbadern
(pronounced <i>Dolbathern</i>) Castle, situated between the two
lakes, and now reduced to one circular tower, thirty feet in
diameter, with the foundations of the exterior buildings
completely in ruins; in this, Owen Gough, <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>brother to
Llewellin, last prince, was confined in prison.&nbsp; From hence
a rugged horse-path brought us to the Caernarvon turnpike-road,
about six miles distant; the high towers of the castle, the very
crown and paragon of the landscape, at last pointed out the
situation of</p>
<h3>CAERNARVON;</h3>
<p>and having crossed a handsome modern stone-bridge, thrown over
the river Rhydol, and built by &ldquo;Harry Parry, the modern
Inigo, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1791,&rdquo; we soon entered this
ancient town, very much fatigued with our long excursion.&nbsp;
The Hotel, newly built by Lord Uxbridge, for the convenience of
strangers, at the end of the town, commands a fine prospect of
the Strait of Menai.&nbsp; The view was bounded by the flat Isle
of Anglesea; while the light vessels, skimming before the wind,
gave the whole a lively and pleasing variety.</p>
<p>The city of Caernarvon, beautifully situated, and regularly
built, is in the form of a square, enclosed on three sides, with
thick stone walls; and on the south side, defended by the
castle;&mdash;the old town-hall is now falling to ruin.</p>
<p>With respect to the castle, we by no means agree with Mr.
Warner, that &ldquo;its high antiquity and ancient <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>splendour
is interrupted and destroyed by the patch-work of modern
separation, and the littleness of a cottager&rsquo;s domestic
&oelig;conomy seen within its walls;&rdquo; as it is only
repaired, where necessity required it, to prop up its crumbling
ruins; neither could we discover any cottage within its
walls.&nbsp; The towers are extremely elegant; but not being
entwined with ivy, do not wear that picturesque appearance, which
castles generally possess.&nbsp; Over the principal entrance,
which leads into an oblong court, is seated, beneath a great
tower, the statue of the founder, holding in his left hand a
dagger: this gate-way was originally fortified with four
portcullises.&nbsp; At the west end, the eagle tower, remarkably
light and beautiful, in a polygon form; three small hexagon
turrets rising from the middle, with eagles placed on their
battlements; from thence it derives its name.&nbsp; In a little
dark room <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a> in this tower, measuring eleven feet
by seven, was born Edward the Second, April 25, 1204.&nbsp; The
thickness of the wall is about ten feet.&nbsp; To the top of the
tower we reckoned one hundred and fifty-eight steps, from whence
an extensive view of the adjacent country is seen to great
advantage.&nbsp; On the south are three octagonal towers with
small turrets, with <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>similar ones on the north.&nbsp; All
these towers communicate with each other by a gallery, both on
the ground, middle, and upper floor, formed within the immense
thickness of the walls, in which are cut narrow slips, at
convenient distances, for the discharge of arrows.</p>
<p>This building, founded on a rock, is the work of Edward I. the
conqueror of the principality; the form of it is a long irregular
square, enclosing an area of about two acres and a half.&nbsp;
From the information of the Sebright manuscript, Mr. Pennant
says, that by the united efforts of the peasants, it was erected
within the space of one year.</p>
<p>Having spent near three hours surveying one of the noblest
castles in Wales, we walked round the environs of the town: the
terrace round the castle walls is exceedingly pleasing, being in
front of the Menai, which is here upwards of a mile in breadth,
forming a safe harbour for craft of five or six tons, and
generally crowded with vessels, exhibiting a picture of national
industry; whilst near it a commodious quay presents an
ever-bustling scene, from whence a considerable quantity of
slate, and likewise copper from the Llanberris mine, is shipped
for different parts of the kingdom.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>Caernarvon may certainly be considered as one of the
handsomest and largest towns in North-Wales; and under the
patronage of Lord Uxbridge promises to become still more populous
and extensive: his Lordship, we were given to understand by our
landlord, intends to erect sea-baths; and by this well-planned
improvement, induce company to resort here during the summer
months.</p>
<p>Several excursions may be made from Caernarvon with great
satisfaction to the Tourist; the principal of which is a visit
to</p>
<h3>PLAS-NEWYDD,</h3>
<p>the elegant seat of Lord Uxbridge, situated in the Isle of
Anglesey, and distant about six miles from Caernarvon: if the
wind and tide prove favourable, the picturesque scenery of the
Menai, will be viewed to great advantage, by hiring a boat at the
quay. <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a>&nbsp; But if this most advisable plan
should not be approved of, the walk to the Mol-y-don Ferry, about
five miles on the Bangor road, will prove highly gratifying: the
Menai, whose banks are studded with gentlemens&rsquo; seats,
appearing scarcely visible between the rich foliage of the oak,
which luxuriates <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>to the water&rsquo;s brink, is filled with vessels,
whose gay streamers, glittering to the sun-beam, present to the
eye a constant, moving object; whilst the voice of the sailors,
exchanging some salute with the passing vessel, is gently wafted
on the breeze.</p>
<p>Crossing the ferry, we soon reached the ancient residence of
the Arch-Druid of Britain, and where was formerly stationed the
most celebrated of the ancient British Academies; from this
circumstance, many places in this island still retain their
original appellation, as <i>Myfyrim</i>, the Place of Studies;
<i>Caer Edris</i>, the City of Astronomy; <i>Cerrig Boudyn</i>,
the Astronomer&rsquo;s Circle.&nbsp; The shore to the right soon
brought us to the Plantations of Pl&acirc;s-Newydd, consisting
chiefly of the most venerable oaks, and noblest ash in this part
of the country.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Superior to the pow&rsquo;r<br />
Of all the warring winds of heaven they rise;<br />
And from the stormy promontory tower,<br />
And toss their giant arms amid the skies;<br />
While each assailing blast increasing strength
supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Beattie&rsquo;s
</span><span class="smcap"><i>Minstrel</i></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beneath their &ldquo;broad brown&rdquo; branches, we
discovered several <i>cromlechs</i>, the monuments of Druidical
superstition; several stones of enormous size support <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>two others
placed horizontally over them. <a name="citation118"></a><a
href="#footnote118" class="citation">[118]</a>&nbsp; For what
purpose these ancient relicks were originally erected, it was not
for us puisne antiquarians to discuss, and with eager impatience
we hurried to visit the noble mansion, which has not yet received
the finishing stroke of the architect; sufficient however is
accomplished to form a conjecture of its intended splendour and
magnificence.&nbsp; The whole is built, stables included, in a
Gothic castellated form, of a dark slate-coloured stone; on
entering the vestibule, we, for a short time, imagined ourselves
in the chapel, a mistake, though soon discovered, yet liable to
happen to any visitor; the ceiling having Gothic arches, with a
gallery suitable to it, and several niches cut in the side walls:
we were next conduced through a long suite of apartments, the
design of them all equally convenient and elegant.&nbsp; The
landscape from the Gothic windows is both beautiful and sublime;
a noble plantation of trees, the growth of ages&mdash;the winding
strait of the Menai, gay with vessels passing and repassing; and
beyond this tranquil scene, the long range of the Snowdon
mountains shooting into the clouds, the various hues of whose
features appear as beautiful, as their magnitude is
sublime.&nbsp; The house is protected <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>from the encroachment of the sea, by
a strong parapet embattled wall; in fine, this magnificent seat
of Lord Uxbridge, seems to possess many conveniencies peculiar to
its situation: the warm and cold baths, constantly filled by the
Menai, are sequestered and commodious, and every apartment of the
house is abundantly supplied with water. <a
name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a"
class="citation">[119a]</a></p>
<p>Being unavoidably prevented visiting the celebrated Paris
mountain, the property of Lord Uxbridge and the Rev. Mr. Hughes,
we again returned to the Hotel, at Caernarvon, purporting to stay
the following day, (Sunday) for the purpose of making a strict
enquiry into the religious sect, settled here, and in many parts
of Wales, called <i>Jumpers</i>. <a name="citation119b"></a><a
href="#footnote119b" class="citation">[119b]</a>&nbsp; The
account we had received from our landlord, we imagined was <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>exaggerated, and this more strongly induced us to visit
the chapel, that we might be enabled, in future, to contradict
this ridiculous report.</p>
<p>At six in the evening the congregation assembled, and on our
entrance into the chapel, we observed on the north side, from a
sort of stage or pulpit, erected on the occasion, a man, in
appearance, a common day-labourer, holding forth to an ignorant
and deluded multitude.&nbsp; Our entrance at first, seemed to
excite a general dissatisfaction; and our near neighbours, as if
conscious of their eccentricities, muttered bitter complaints
against the admittance of strangers.&nbsp; The chapel, which was
not divided into pews, and even destitute of seats, contained
near an hundred people; half way round was erected a
gallery.&nbsp; The preacher continued raving, and, indeed,
foaming at the mouth, in a manner too shocking to
relate:&mdash;he allowed himself no time to breathe, but
seemingly intoxicated, uttered the most dismal howls and groans
imaginable, which were answered by the congregation, so loud, as
occasionally to drown even the voice of the preacher.&nbsp; At
last, being nearly exhausted by continual vociferation, and
fainting from exertion, he sunk down in the pulpit: the meeting,
however, did not disperse; a psalm was immediately sung by a man,
who, we imagine, officiated as clerk, accompanied by the whole <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>congregation.&nbsp; The psalm had not continued long,
before we observed part of the assembly, to our great surprise,
<i>jumping</i> in small parties of three, four, and sometimes
five in a set, lifting up their hands, beating their breasts, and
making the most horrid gesticulations.&nbsp; Each individual
separately jumped, regularly succeeding one another, while the
rest generally assisted the jumper by the help of their
hands.&nbsp; The women always appeared more vehement than the
men, and infinitely surpassed them in numbers; seeming to
endeavour to excel each other in jumping, screaming, and
howling.&nbsp; We observed, indeed, that many of them lost their
shoes, hats, and bonnets, with the utmost indifference, and never
condescended to search after them; in this condition, it is not
unusual to meet them jumping to their homes.&nbsp; Their meetings
are twice a week, Wednesdays and Sundays.&nbsp; Having
accidentally met with a gentleman, at the Hotel, a native of
Siberia, we invited him to our party, and, induced by curiosity,
he readily accompanied us to the chapel.&nbsp; On the
commencement of the <i>jumping</i>, he intreated us to quit the
congregation, exclaiming, &ldquo;Good God! I for a moment forgot
I was in a Christian country; the dance of the Siberians, in the
worship of the Lama, with their shouts and gesticulations, is not
more horrid!&rdquo;&nbsp; This observation so forcibly struck me,
that I could not avoid inserting it in my note-book.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>With
disgust we left the chapel, and were given to understand, by our
landlord, they celebrate a particular day every year, when
instances have been known of women dying by too great an
exertion; and fainting is frequently the consequence of their
excessive jumping.</p>
<p>This sect is by no means confined to the town of Caernarvon,
but in many villages, and in several market towns, both in North
and South Wales, <a name="citation122a"></a><a
href="#footnote122a" class="citation">[122a]</a> they have
established regular chapels.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have&rdquo; (says
a correspondent to the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, <a
name="citation122b"></a><a href="#footnote122b"
class="citation">[122b]</a>) &ldquo;periodical meetings in many
of the larger towns, to which they come from thirty to forty
miles round.&nbsp; At one, held in Denbigh, about last April,
there were, I believe, upwards of four thousand people, from
different parts.&nbsp; At another, held in Bala, soon afterwards,
nearly double that number were supposed to be
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last number appears rather to be
exaggerated, though the latter, being dated from Denbigh, should
be considered as authoritative.</p>
<p>Another correspondent to the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, gives
the following information respecting the sect: &ldquo;That they
are not a distinct sect, but <i>Methodists</i>, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>of the same
persuasion as the late Mr. Whitfield; for though there are
several congregations of <i>Wesleyan Methodists</i>, in this
country, there is no such custom amongst them.&nbsp; But jumping
during religious worship is no new thing amongst the other party,
having (by what I can learn) been practised by them for many
years past.&nbsp; I have seen some of their pamphlets, in the
Welch language, in which this custom is justified by the example
of David, who danced before the ark; and of the lame man,
restored by our blessed Saviour, at the gate of the Temple, who
leaped for joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; How far this gentleman&rsquo;s
account may be accurate, I leave for others to decide; it is
certainly to be lamented, in a country where the Christian
Religion is preached in a stile of the greatest purity and
simplicity, that those poor ignorant deluded wretches should be
led to a form of worship so dissonant to the Established Church
of England, and, indeed, by a poor ignorant fellow, devoid of
education, and devoid of sense.</p>
<p>The same road we had so much admired the preceding Saturday,
soon brought us to</p>
<h3>BANGOR,</h3>
<p>the supposed scite of the Bovium, or Bonium, a Roman <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>station,
and celebrated for the most ancient British monastery, which
contained two thousand four hundred monks: it has long retained
its British name, <i>Bangor</i>, or <i>Bancher</i>, signifying
&ldquo;a beautiful quire;&rdquo; an appellation it justly
merits.&nbsp; The situation is deeply secluded, &ldquo;far from
the bustle of a jarring world,&rdquo; and must have accorded well
with monastic melancholy; for the Monks, emerging from their
retired cells, might here indulge in that luxurious melancholy,
which the prospect inspires, and which would sooth the asperities
which the severe discipline of superstition inflicted on
them.&nbsp; The situation of Banchor appears more like a scene of
airy enchantment, than reality, and the residences of the canons
are endeared to the votaries of landscape by the prospect they
command.&nbsp; On the opposite shore, the town of Beaumaris is
straggling up the steep declivity, with its quay crowded with
vessels, and all appeared bustle and confusion; the contrast
which the nearer prospect inspired, was too evident to escape our
notice, where the</p>
<blockquote><p>Oak, whose boughs were moss&rsquo;d with age,<br
/>
And high top bald with dry antiquity,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>afforded a seat for the contemplation of the wide expanse of
the ocean, which is seen beyond the little Island of Puffin, or
Priestholm; so called, from the <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>quantity of birds of that species,
which resort here in the summer-months.</p>
<p>The cathedral has been built at different times, but no part
very ancient; it was made an episcopal see, about the time of the
conquest: the church was burnt down by Owen Glendwr, in the reign
of Henry IV. the choir was afterwards built by Bishop Henry Dene,
<a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a"
class="citation">[125a]</a> between 1496 and 1500; the tower and
nave by Bishop Skevington, 1532.&nbsp; The whole is Gothic
architecture, with no other particular ornament to distinguish it
from a common English parish church.&nbsp; There are, however,
several bishops <a name="citation125b"></a><a
href="#footnote125b" class="citation">[125b]</a> buried in the
choir.&nbsp; I could dwell with pleasure on the picturesque
beauties of this little episcopal see; but a repetition of the
same epithets <i>grand</i>, <i>beautiful</i>, <i>sublime</i>,
<i>fine</i>, with a long catalogue, which must necessarily occur,
would appear tautologous on paper, though their archetypes in
nature would <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>assume new colours at every change of position of the
beholder.&nbsp; From this retirement, a ferry-boat soon conveyed
us to</p>
<h3>BEAUMARIS,</h3>
<p>the largest and best built town in Anglesea, where the same
busy scene occurred.&nbsp; Having taken a short survey of Baron
Hill, the seat of Lord Bulkley, commanding a fine prospect of the
ocean, with the huge promontory of Pen-mawn-maur, we were soon
convinced, that there was nothing to require a longer stay; and
returning to Bangor, we pursued the road to Conway.&nbsp; About
two miles on our left, we parted the Park and Castle of Penrhyn,
the seat of Lord Penrhyn: this has lately been considerably
enlarged and repaired, under the judicious direction of Mr.
Wyat.&nbsp; The entrance is remarkably elegant, resembling a
triumphal arch.&nbsp; This mansion enjoys a boundless prospect of
the ocean on one side, appearing but feebly restrained by a long
tract of scarcely visible coast on the other; in front, the flat
Island of Anglesea, the lofty Pen-mawn-mawr, and the extensive
point of Caernarvonshire: whilst the neat Church of Landegai
forms a nearer object for admiration.&nbsp; We soon reached the
dark lowering promontory of Pen-mawn-mawr, about <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>eight miles
from Bangor, rising perpendicularly, in a massy wall, to the
height of one thousand four hundred feet: huge fragments of
shattered rock are scattered by the side of the road, and a wall,
scarcely five feet high, alone protects a carriage from the steep
precipice; which, from the slightness of the foundation, has even
fallen down in many parts.&nbsp; In this awfully sublime
situation we remained for some time, astonished at the bold
protuberance of the rocks, which seemed to project their dark
sides, to augment the idle roar of the waves.</p>
<p>Pursuing a good turnpike-road, we soon came in sight of the
hoary towers of</p>
<h3>CONWAY CASTLE.</h3>
<p>An air of proud sublimity, united with singular wildness,
characterises the place.&nbsp; The evening was far advanced; and
part of its ruins were shining with the purple glow of the
setting sun, whose remaining features stood in darkened majesty,
when we entered this monument of desolation.&nbsp; Passing over a
plank, originally the scite of the draw-bridge, we came into the
outward court, strongly defended with battlements; from thence we
examined the grand entrance of the castle, with several abutments
projecting forward, similar <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>in stile to Caernarvon.&nbsp; On the
south side of the court is the grand hall, measuring an hundred
and thirty feet by thirty-two, with eight light Gothic arches,
five of which are still in good condition.&nbsp; On one end is
the chapel with a large window, a beautiful specimen of Gothic
architecture.&nbsp; It is founded on the solid rock, by Edward I.
in the year 1284: the walls are from eleven to fifteen feet
thick: all the towers are defended by smaller round ones,
projecting two or three feet over, with a regular communication
round the whole castle by galleries, on the same plan as at
Caernarvon.&nbsp; The steps are decayed and broken, and the
looseness of the stones rendered a footing very insecure; but,
impelled by an irresistible curiosity, we ascended the most
perfect tower, and an extensive prospect presented itself to our
view.&nbsp; The foundation of one of the principal towers,
looking towards a small river, which here joins the Conway, has
lately given way, and torn down with it part of the building; the
remainder now hangs in an extraordinary manner.&nbsp; The whole
town is enclosed within strong walls, and defended by a number of
towers, which communicate with the castle by a gallery; there are
likewise several gate-ways, at certain distances.</p>
<p>The ancient Church next attracted our attention; but did not
detain us long, as the monuments for <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>the Wynnes, are the only things
worthy of inspection.&nbsp; From thence we surveyed the remains
of the College, which in the reign of Edward I. was intended for
the instruction of youth: it is now in complete ruins: the
workmanship curious, with several sculptured arms.&nbsp; In this
town is an ancient house, built in the form of a quadrangle, by
the Wynnes, in the time of Elizabeth, now inhabited by poor
families.&nbsp; This house is adorned, after the fantastical
fashion of the times, in which it was erected; the roof is
singularly carved, and the front decorated with the arms of
England, with several curious crests, birds, and beasts: it bears
the date of 1585.&nbsp; The arms of Elizabeth are carved over the
door, fronting the street.</p>
<p>The trade of Conway consists in the exportation of slate, and
copper from the Llandidno mines, from whence the finest specimens
of the Malachite copper is brought.&nbsp; The town and castle of
Conway are seen to great advantage in crossing the river, which
is here nearly a mile over, and at high water washes the walls of
that massy ruin: in the middle of the channel is a small rocky
island.&nbsp; We observed, from this situation, the two castles,
called Bodscaleen and Dyganwy; the small remains of the latter
stand on a high rock above the river; the former is a beautiful
seat of the Mostyns.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>We
were soon transported into Denbighshire; an extensive prospect of
the ocean presented itself before us, and we discovered the
mountains of the Isle of Man, which could scarcely be
distinguished from the clouds of Heaven, and the waves of the
sea.&nbsp; In descending a hill, about two miles from the neat
bathing-town of</p>
<h3>ABERGELE,</h3>
<p>we observed, on our right, two immense caverns, about half way
up the mountain; they are called Cavern-arogo, and run four or
five hundred yards into the ground; but their real extent has
never yet been ascertained with accuracy.&nbsp; From these
mountains, vast quantities of lime are shipped for Liverpool, and
many parts of England; they are said to be inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Abergele, situated on the edge of Rhuddlan Marsh, is a small
neat town, of one street, resorted to in the summer-season for
bathing.&nbsp; The sands afford excellent walking; in the evening
we lingered on the beach for a considerable time, enjoying the
calm, but cheerful beauty of Nature, and inhaling the pure
sea-breeze&mdash;for,</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;&mdash;The wind was hush&rsquo;d,<br />
And to the beach each slowly-lifted wave,<br />
Creeping with silver curl, just kist the shore,<br />
And slept in silence.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Mason&rsquo;s</span> <i>Garden</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With pleasure, mixed with reverential awe, we trod Rhuddlan
Marsh, so celebrated in the annals of history.&nbsp; Here the
ill-fated Richard the Second was betrayed into the hands of
Bolinbroke, and taken prisoner to Flint: here the famous King <a
name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a> of Mercia met his untimely death: here
the Welsh, under the command of Caradoc, in the year 795, were
defeated in a conflict with the Saxons, and their leader slain in
the action.&nbsp; This memorable and tragical event is handed
down to posterity, by an ancient celebrated ballad, called
<i>Morva Rhuddlan</i>, or the Marsh of Rhuddlan, composed by the
bards on the death of Prince Caradoc.</p>
<p>The ground we trod, connected with so many events, revived in
our minds, the memory of past ages, a series of historical events
came to our recollection; events, that are now so distant, as
almost to be obliterated from the page of history.&nbsp; Passing
over a bridge of two arches, thrown over the river Clwyd, we
entered</p>
<h3><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>RHUDDLAN,</h3>
<p>once the largest and most respectable town in
North-Wales.&nbsp; Walking over the ruins of the castle, I
recurred, by a natural association of ideas, to the times, when
the Parliament-house, the balls, and courts echoed with the
voices of those, who have long since been swept from the earth,
by the unerring hand of death.&nbsp; One solitary Gothic window
is now only remaining, to distinguish the old Parliament-house,
where Edward the First instituted that famous code of laws, under
the title of the <i>Statute of Rhuddlan</i>, from a neighbouring
barn; and, what once contained the Parliament of England, now
contains nothing but bark for the supply of a tan-yard.</p>
<p>The old castle is built of red stone; it consists of a square
area, strongly fortified with a wall: this court we entered
through the grand gate-way, between two round towers: the
opposite side corresponds.&nbsp; The whole is encircled by a deep
entrenchment, faced with stone on the river side, with two square
towers, one of which still remains.</p>
<p>The road from hence to</p>
<h3><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>ST.
ASAPH,</h3>
<p>affords a most rich and beautiful walk, extending along the
celebrated vale of Clwyd.&nbsp; This rich tract of land, called,
<i>The Eden of North-Wales</i>, extends in length about
twenty-five miles, and in breadth about eight.&nbsp; The
neighbourhood of Ruthin afford the best view of this vale: though
it is by no means so interesting and romantic, as the vale of
Glamorganshire, yet its high cultivation, and picturesque, but
moderate height of the hills, rising on each side of the river
Clwyd, renders the scenery pleasing: its chief produce is
corn.&nbsp; Both these vales claim the attention of the
traveller; and both have to boast of particular beauties.&nbsp;
One mile from St. Asaph, we passed, on our right, the elegant
seat of Sir Edward Lloyd.&nbsp; We still followed the banks the
Clwyd, and at the farthest extremity a light elegant bridge, of
seven arches, with the dark Tower of St. Asaph&rsquo;s Cathedral,
rising on an eminence just over it, gave a picturesque effect to
the whole scenery.</p>
<p>The town itself is built on a hill, in one strait line, with a
few neat houses.&nbsp; The Cathedral naturally demands attention;
the inside is remarkably neat and elegant, entirely Gothic, with
the ceiling of chesnut, and open ribs, like the skeleton of a
ship: it has lately <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>been repaired by Mr. Turner,
architect of Whitchurch, at the great expence of two thousand
four hundred pounds.&nbsp; The monument of David ap Owen, Bishop
of this diocese, was particularly pointed out to us.&nbsp; The
Bishop&rsquo;s Palace has been entirely rebuilt by the present
diocesan.&nbsp; The Choir consists of a Bishop, Dean, six Canons,
seven Prebends, and four Vicars.&nbsp; There are no monuments in
the church-yard, and few of any importance within its venerable
walls.</p>
<p>St. Asaph receives its derivation from its patron, who
established a Bishop&rsquo;s see here, in the year 590: but in
British it is named <i>Llan-Elwy</i>, on account of the conflux
of the Elwy with the Clywd.&nbsp; It is singular, that the
Bishop&rsquo;s jurisdiction extends over no entire county, but
part of Flintshire, Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire,
Merionethshire, and Shropshire.</p>
<p>The tract of land extending from hence to</p>
<h3>DENBIGH,</h3>
<p>is extremely rich in wood, pasture, and corn, but very
deficient in water; directly contrary to the rugged scenes of
Caernarvonshire; the summits of whose mountains appeared still
visible in the distant retrospect, <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>mingling with the clouds.&nbsp;
About a mile from St. Asaph, we were particularly pleased with an
old oak, whose arms extending entirely across the road, formed a
most elegantly shaped arch.</p>
<p>Denbigh, situated nearly in the centre of the vale of Clwyd,
is a well-built town, standing on the declivity of a hill.&nbsp;
A large manufactory of shoes and gloves is here carried on, and
annually supplies London with a vast quantity.&nbsp; The ruins of
the castle, still remaining on a rock, commanding the town, are
too celebrated in history, and too cruelly shattered by the
ravages of war, to be passed unnoticed.&nbsp; The principal
entrance forms a fine Gothic arch, with the statue of King Edward
the First its founder, above it, in an elegant nich, curiously
carved, encircled with a square stone frame.&nbsp; No part of
this castle is perfect; but the huge thick fragments, which are
scattered in the most extraordinary and fantastical manner, seem
to tell its former magnificence; and a present view of things,
such as they are, with a retrospect of what they originally were,
spreads a gloom over the mind, and interrupts the pleasure of
contemplation; yet still, the singular character of this ruin is
particularly interesting.&nbsp; Masses of wall still remain, the
proud effigies of sinking greatness; and the shattered tower
seems to nod at every murmur of the blast, and menace the
observer with immediate <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>annihilation.&nbsp; Amongst these
ruins we lingered till the whole was silvered by the pale rays of
the moon.&nbsp; To form a conjecture, on the extent of its
apartments, is now impossible; but it is thus described by
Leland, in his <i>Itinerary</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The castelle is a very large thinge, and
hath many toures yn it; but the body of the worke was never
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gate-house is a marvellous strong and great peace
of work, but the fastigia of it were never finished.&nbsp; If
they had beene, it might have beene countid among the most
memorable peaces of workys in England.&nbsp; It hath diverse
wardes and dyverse portcolicis.&nbsp; On the front of the gate is
set the image of Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln, in his stately long
robes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another very high towre, and larg, in the
castelle caullid the Redde Towre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sum say, that the erle of Lincoln&rsquo;s sunne felle
into the castelle welle, and ther dyed; whereupon he never passid
to finisch the castelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;King Edward the Fourth was besieged in Denbigh <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>castelle,
and ther it was pactid between king Henry&rsquo;s men and hym
that he should with life departe the reaulme, never to
returne.&nbsp; If they had taken king Edwarde there debellatum
fuisset.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parish church stands within the walls of the original
town.&nbsp; Below the castle are the fragments of an old church,
which for particular reasons, that cannot now be ascertained, was
never finished: it contains nine windows on two sides, with a
large and handsome one on the east.</p>
<p>The vale of Clwyd still retains the character of luxuriant
fertility; about two miles from hence, in our way to</p>
<h3>RUTHIN,</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Denbigh, fair empress of the vale,&rdquo; with its
tottering towers, formed a most beautiful landscape; whilst the
neat little hamlet of Whitchurch peeped from among the pomp of
groves.&nbsp; At the small village of St. Fynnon St. Dyfnog, this
curious inscription over a door,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Near this place, within a vault,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is such liquor fix&rsquo;d,<br />
You&rsquo;ll say that water, hops, and malt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were never better mix&rsquo;d;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>invited the &ldquo;weary-way wanderer,&rdquo; to
partake of the <i>good things</i> within: this inclined us to be
better acquainted with the author of this <i>extraordinary</i>
stanza; and we intreated the Landlord to be our director to the
much-esteemed well of St. Dyfnog.&nbsp; Passing through the
church-yard, and from thence through the passage of an
alms&rsquo;-house, we reached a plantation of trees, with a broad
gravel-walk, almost concealed from day&rsquo;s garish light, by
the thick foliage: this brought us to the fountain, enclosed in
an angular wall, which forms a bath of considerable size; and
so</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&ldquo;far
retir&rsquo;d<br />
Among the windings of a woody vale,<br />
By solitude and deep surrounding shades,<br />
But more by bashful modesty, conceal&rsquo;d;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that the &ldquo;lovely young Lavinia&rdquo; might here plunge
into the flood, secure from the intrusion of Palemon.&nbsp; Many
wonderful qualities are attributed to this fountain; but it is
more particularly celebrated for the cure of the rheumatism: the
water has no peculiar taste.&nbsp; We returned by a subterraneous
path under the road, which led to the pleasure-grounds, adjoining
the seat of Major Wylyn.</p>
<p>Several seats were beautifully dispersed on each side of the
vale; among which, Lord Bagot&rsquo;s and Lord <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Kirkwall&rsquo;s formed the most prominent features in
the landscape.</p>
<p>Ruthin is a large neat town, only divided from the parish of
Llanruth, by a strong stone bridge: the scite of the church is
extremely pretty, and is a handsome modern edifice: here is a
monument to Dr. Gabriel Goodman, Dean of Westminster, in the time
of Elizabeth, and likewise a native of this place.&nbsp; A new
gaol has lately been built here by Mr. Turner.&nbsp; The remains
of the castle, at the southern extremity of the town, are
scarcely worthy a moment&rsquo;s observation; and the scite of
the old chapel is now converted into a bowling-green.&nbsp; Owen
Glendwr demolished this town by fire, September 20, 1400.&nbsp;
In the last century, the loyalists fortified the castle, and
sustained a long siege in 1646.</p>
<p>We still continued skirting the rich vale of Clwyd; but
winding up a steep hill, overlooking the whole of it, from one
extremity to the other, we were reluctantly compelled to bid a
final adieu to all its vistas, hamlets, steeples; the whole
prospect, glowing with luxuriance, seemed to assume fresh
beauties, at this our farewell view: the cattle, which were
grazing in the shorn meadows, and beautifully contrasted with the
ripening corn, appeared more animated; and we discovered, or <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>thought we
discovered, an additional number of villages, peeping from the
woody skirts of the sloping hills.&nbsp; From this point the vale
is certainly seen to great advantage.&nbsp; To give a still
greater effect, a thunder-storm came rolling on; and the clouds
were</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Silent borne along, heavy and slow,<br />
With the big stores of steaming oceans charg&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This storm compelled us to seek for a shelter, in a miserable
pot-house; but the civility of the landlady fully compensated for
its want of accommodations.&nbsp; The effects of the storm
rendered the remainder of our journey much more agreeable, and
the heat less oppressive: a dull, uninteresting road continued,
till we arrived within four or five miles of</p>
<h3>WREXHAM.</h3>
<p>The contrast was too striking to escape our notice; but having
climbed a steep eminence, the eye commanded an almost boundless
range of land; and the faint colour of the hills, retiring in the
distance, was beautifully combined with the mellow green of
nearer woods.&nbsp; The counties of Cheshire, Shropshire, and a
considerable part of Wales, were extended, like a map, for our
inspection; the town of Wrexham, rising in <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>the bottom,
animated the scene, with its noble tower, overtopping the
numberless little steeples near it.&nbsp; Close to the road, we
observed several coal and lead mines, and a melting house for
forming lead into pigs; these works belong to Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
<p>The dirty out-skirts of Wrexham, by no means prepossessed us
in favor of the town, but viewing it more leisurely, we can
safely affirm, that it is not only the largest, but the best
built town in Wales.</p>
<p>To the kind attentions of a clergyman in the neighbourhood of
Wrexham, we are much indebted, and under his directions, we
surveyed the lions with great advantage.&nbsp; Our friendly
Ciceroni first conducted us to the church, an elegant building of
the reign of Henry VII.&nbsp; The tower is an hundred and forty
feet high, and esteemed &ldquo;a beautiful specimen of the
florid, or reformed Gothic, which prevailed about that
time;&rdquo; all the figures and ornaments are well designed, and
still in high preservation.&nbsp; The inside is not less elegant;
it has lately been neatly repaired, with a good gallery and
organ: the painted altar piece is well executed.&nbsp; On the
left, facing the altar, is a very handsome monument by
Roubilliac, to the memory of Mrs. Mary Middleton; both the
design, and execution, reflect the highest credit on the
sculptor; <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>the subject is the last day; at the sound of the
trumpet, a tomb of black marble bursts open, and a beautiful
female figure, clothed in white, appears rising from it, just
awoke from the sleep of death; her form dignified; candour,
innocence, and celestial joy shine in her countenance, and gives
it the most feeling and animated expression: in the back ground,
an obelisk, supposed to be erected to her memory, is rent
asunder; above, an angel, enveloped in a cloud, is pointing to
brighter scenes.&nbsp; In this church are two other monuments,
executed by the same celebrated master, in memory of some of the
Middletons; their designs, though striking, cannot be compared to
his last day.&nbsp; Our worthy conductor, perceiving we were
great amateurs of paintings, and careful that nothing of
consequence should be passed unnoticed by us, particularly wished
us to examine the performance of a young artist, then at Wrexham:
a copy amongst others, of a painting of Rembrant&rsquo;s, taken
by Mr. Allen, from a celebrated picture, in the possession of
Lord Craven, was most ingenuously executed; the subject is an old
man, instructing a young boy; the attention of the latter, most
admirably preserved; the head of the former, and the hand
particularly, most highly finished.&nbsp; Without any
exaggeration, this painting would do credit to the most
scientific painter, and be esteemed invaluable; it is therefore
to <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>be
hoped, from the hands of so young an artist as Mr. Allen, that
this performance will be disposed of, where judges of painting
may view it with a critic&rsquo;s eye, and recommend its merits
to those who can afford to encourage industry and ingenuity.</p>
<p>Our friend&rsquo;s invitation to his hospitable parsonage, and
agreeable family, was too kindly urged, possibly to be refused,
and in our way to</p>
<h3>MARCH WIEL,</h3>
<p>we visited the seat of P. York, Esq.&nbsp; The grounds and
plantations, are very extensive; and the bowery walk, while they
afford refreshing shelter from a summer&rsquo;s sun, allow
partial views of the counties of Cheshire and Shropshire; with
the Weeakin and Brydyork hills: in short, through these
groves</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How long so e&rsquo;er the wanderer roves,
each step<br />
Shall wake fresh beauties, each short point presents<br />
A different picture; new, and yet the same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tower of Wrexham, and the town itself, as occasion offers,
is a nearer, and an additional charming object.&nbsp; In an
alteration of the walks a few years since, were discovered below
the surface of the ground, <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the shattered walls of an ancient
castle; these fragments Mr. Yorke has left unimpaired, and they
remain a momento of the vicissitudes of fortune.&nbsp; The
entrenchments round the castle, and likewise the original scite
of the keep, are still very apparent.</p>
<p>The house itself is very indifferent: Watt&rsquo;s dyke runs
through part of the grounds.&nbsp; In a parlour opposite the
garden, we observed some fine paintings of the Hardwick
family.&nbsp; Mr. Yorke has dedicated another room to the royal
tribes of Wales, <a name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a> where the arms and lines of the
descent, as far as they can be traced, are emblazoned and hung
up.</p>
<p>In the coolness of the evening, our hospitable host, conducted
us to the neat and elegant little country church of March Wiel,
lately cased with stone; and in the year 1788, ornamented with a
new painted window by Mr. Eginton, of Birmingham; the twenty-one
compartments contain the arms and crests of the Middletons and
Yorks, with rich transparent borders.&nbsp; This window is
undoubtedly very elegant, but the subject in my own opinion, more
adapted to a hall, <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>than an ornament to a church window.&nbsp; The high
tower appears not in proportion with the body of the church.</p>
<p>Deeply impressed with sentiments of gratitude towards our
Reverend friend, and sensible of his hospitality and kind
intentions, we took leave of him early the next morning, and
pursued our route to</p>
<h3>RUABON,</h3>
<p>purporting to visit Wynstay Park, the much admired seat of Sir
Watkin Williams Wynne.&nbsp; On leaving Marchwiel, a most
delightful prospect spread before us; in the retrospect, the
tower of Wrexham Church brought to our recollection the views of
Magdalen College Tower, in the vicinity of Oxford.</p>
<p>The park of Wynstay is well stocked with red deer; excellent
plantations; and the house is an elegant modern structure, but
nothing in the inside particularly deserving the attention of the
traveller.&nbsp; In the grounds, the chief object, worthy of
inspection, is a very elegant obelisk, now erecting to the memory
of the present Sir Watkin&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; The height is an
hundred and one feet; the base of it sixteen, and the top nine,
built with <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>free-stone, and fluted: round the top is formed a
gallery, with a handsome urn in bronze, after an elegant design,
cast in London; round the base of the column, are wreaths of oak
leaves, in the beaks of four eagles, cast in the same
metal.&nbsp; On the south-west side is a door, with a stair-case
within the obelisk leading to the top: we regretted that the key
could not be procured, as the prospect from that eminence must be
extremely fine.&nbsp; On the other three sides, an appropriate
inscription, in English, Welch, and Latin, is to be carved.</p>
<p>Through this park runs Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, thrown up by the
great King of Mercia, from whence it derives its name, to check
the irruptions of the Welch, mark the confines of each country,
and give greater security to his own.&nbsp; It begins at
Basingwerk, in Flintshire, and ends at Chepstow, in
Monmouthshire; extending a line of not less than one hundred and
fifty miles, over rocks and mountains.&nbsp; This great
undertaking still retains the ancient name of <i>Clawdh Offa</i>,
or Offa&rsquo;s Dyke.</p>
<p>Passing through the little village of Ruabon, situated at the
extremity of Sir Watkin&rsquo;s Park, a very interesting and
picturesque country, composed of rich vallies, and gently sloping
hills, presented itself to our view; and, at some distance, we
soon caught a glimpse of Chirk <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Castle, a noble seat of the family
of the Myddleton&rsquo;s, standing on an eminence.&nbsp; Four
miles from Llangollen, we enquired for the wonderful</p>
<h3>PONTCYSYLLTY, <a name="citation147"></a><a
href="#footnote147" class="citation">[147]</a></h3>
<p>(pronounced <i>Pont y Casulte</i>) or famous aqueduct, now
erecting over the river Dee, and found ourselves within half a
mile of this great and astonishing undertaking.&nbsp; It is not
yet finished; eleven pillars are already completed, built of
sandy stone, which is dug on the spot; they are fifteen yards
asunder, and their height, from the bed of the river, one hundred
and twenty feet: over the whole is to run an iron trough,
sufficiently deep for barges of considerable burthen.&nbsp; On
the middle column is the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The nobility and
gentry of<br />
The adjacent counties,<br />
Having united their efforts with<br />
The great commercial interest of this country,<br />

By his example.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wonderful aqueduct reflects great honour to the
undertakers of so admirable, as well as valuable enterprize; and,
should their hazardous scheme succeed, the whole nation must
indubitably reap great advantages: several columns must still be
erected, before the level can be accomplished.&nbsp; It is
forming over the most beautiful and romantic part of the river
Dee; a bridge likewise, not far from this spot, adds considerably
to the beauty of the scene.&nbsp; Wood, water, and sloping hills,
all combine to render this vale interesting; <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>several
detached cottages, are sprinkled through its wooded declivities,
and here and there a gentleman&rsquo;s seat, &ldquo;embosomed
high in tufted trees,&rdquo; makes a pleasing feature, in the
fascinating landscape.&nbsp; Returning to the turnpike-road, a
short saunter soon brought us to the romantically-situated town
of</p>
<h3>LLANGOLLEN,</h3>
<p>(pronounced <i>Llangothlen</i>) completely environed with
mountains, with a high hill to our right, bearing on its narrow
peak the small remains of Castel Dinas Bran.&nbsp; The bridge,
adjacent to the town, thrown over the rapid Dee, consisting of
six arches, and formerly esteemed <i>One of the principal Wonders
of Wales</i>, by no means answered our expectations.&nbsp; Some
difficulty, no doubt, attended its first erection, as the
foundation is built on the solid rock: it is now repairing.</p>
<p>The elegant description of the valley in the kingdom of
Amhara, by Dr. Johnson, is very applicable to Llangollen; for
&ldquo;all the blessings of nature seemed here to be collected,
and its evils extracted and excluded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without a sigh
of regret, not like the discontented Rasselas, I could here pass
the remainder of my days, &ldquo;in full conviction, that this
vale contains within its <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>reach all that art or nature can
bestow; <i>I could</i> pity those, whom fate had excluded from
this seat of tranquillity, as the sport of chance, and the slaves
of misery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the enviable situation of Lady
Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby, who thus veiled in obscurity
have fitted up, in a true characteristic stile, an elegant little
cottage, at the west extremity of the town, situated on a knole:
the two rooms, which are allotted for the inspection of
strangers, are very handsomely furnished; the dining-room is
ornamented with drawings, the most favourite spots in the
vicinity being selected as the subjects.&nbsp; The window
commands a prospect of the mountains, which awfully rise in
front.&nbsp; The study, looking on the well-arranged plantations
of the garden, was appropriately furnished with a choice
collection of books: we regretted, in the absence of the
gardener, that we could not gain admittance to the grounds.&nbsp;
The vale of Llangollen, and this enviable retreat, have been the
subject of much admiration both in verse and prose; and highly
deserve the praises, which have been lavished upon it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Say, ivy&rsquo;d Valle Crucis; time

tedious hour beguile?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bridge of Llangollen is thus described by the elegant pen
of Mr. Pennant:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bridge, which was founded by the first
<i>John Trevor</i>, bishop of <i>St. Asaph</i>, <a
name="citation151c"></a><a href="#footnote151c"
class="citation">[151c]</a> who died in 1357, is one of the
<i>Tri Thlws Cymru</i>, or three beauties of <i>Wales</i>: but
more remarkable for its situation than structure.&nbsp; It
consists of five arches; whose widest does not exceed
twenty-eight feet in diameter.&nbsp; The river usually runs under
only one; where it has formed a black chasm of vast depth, into
which the water pours with great fury, from a high broken ledge,
formed in the smooth, and solid rock, which composes the whole
bed of the river.&nbsp; The view through the arches, either
upwards or downwards, is extremely picturesque.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having satisfied our curiosity, Dinas Bran, or Crow <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Castle,
next invited our attention, and having attained the summit of a
steep and craggy hill, commanding a pleasing view of Llangollen,
we arrived at the ruins, which crest this precipice.&nbsp; The
remains of this castle are now so trifling, that it scarcely
repays even the enthusiast the trouble of ascending; its
appearance is by no means picturesque, not a tree to give effect
to the crumbling walls; nor has time spared one of the
towers.</p>
<p>It was formerly the residence of Myfanwy Vechan, so celebrated
in verse.&nbsp; The castle is built of the stone which composes
the hill, on which it is erected.&nbsp; The prospect is very
pleasing.&nbsp; Chirk Castle, Wynstay Park, <a
name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a> and many other seats of
respectability, more particularly conspicuous; great part of the
vale, and the meandering course of the Dee, may here be traced;
whilst the opposite hills are shelved off in an extraordinary and
unusual manner, resembling so many walls, or
fortifications.&nbsp; Having descended this steep eminence, we
continued our route to Valle Crucis Abbey, about two miles
distant from Llangollen.&nbsp; It would be advisable for
strangers first to visit Valle Crucis, and take Dinas Bran Castle
in their way back to their inn.&nbsp; The <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>transmutations of time are frequently ridiculous: the
long aisles of this monastery, which were once only responsive to
the slow-breathed chaunt, now repeat the rude dissonance of
ducks, cows, and all manner of poultry.&nbsp; Instead of these
emblems of rusticity, the mind&rsquo;s eye is more accustomed to
appropriate these antique edifices to the midnight procession of
monks issuing from their cells, to perform the solemn
service.&nbsp; These neglected walls are too deeply-shrouded in
their melancholy grove of ash-trees, to be seen to advantage; an
axe, judiciously used, would be of service to the ruin, as the
elegant window of the chapel is completely concealed by the
luxuriant vegetation around; still, however, a pleasing
melancholy pervades the whole scene.&nbsp; The abbey is
beautifully skreened, on all sides, by woody hills, which
entirely protect it from the inclemency of the winter.</p>
<p>This ancient cistertian monastery was founded by Madoc ap
Griffith Maylor, in the year 1200, and is sometimes called
Llan-Egwiste, or Llanegwast.&nbsp; In this vale is the pillar of
Eglwyseg; but the country people appeared quite ignorant of its
situation.&nbsp; Returning to Llangollen, we pursued the turnpike
road to the neat village of</p>
<h3><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>CHIRK.</h3>
<p>For some way we followed the strait and formal course of a
canal, near this, communicating with the Pont-y-Casulte; we again
paused to survey this wonderful design.&nbsp; The vale, on our
left, was indescribably beautiful; and over the whole was
diffused the purple glow of the even.&nbsp; The prospect was
composed of the miniature parts of the immense landscape we had
viewed from Dinas Bran Hill, each of which we now contemplated
separately as a scene.&nbsp; The moon&rsquo;s checkered gleam
besilvered the walls of Chirk Castle, just as we entered the Hand
Inn, where, after the fatigues of a long walk, we met with
excellent accommodations, when considered as a village.</p>
<p>After breakfast the next morning, we endeavoured to obtain
admission to see the inside of Chirk Castle, but without success,
though now only inhabited by servants, who were peremptorily
commanded to admit no strangers.&nbsp; It is situated on an
eminence, surrounded by a park, and fine plantations, which are
very judiciously laid out; this elegant mansion has been in the
possession of the Myddleton family, ever since the year
1614.&nbsp; Having gratified ourselves with a survey of this
noble park, we returned to the Oswestry road.&nbsp; Leaving the
<a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>village
of Chirk, we crossed a new bridge, of one arch, elegantly
constructed: near is another aqueduct, of considerable extent,
now erecting over this river and valley, which, though very
inferior to the Pont-y-Casulte, is still a great undertaking: it
is several hundred yards in length, and the brick piers rise
fifty or sixty feet above the level of the water.&nbsp; Near this
is a rich coal mine, lately discovered.&nbsp; From hence to
Oswestry, we traversed a rich enclosed country, and enjoyed a
scene particularly pleasing: all the inhabitants were collected,
to gather in the produce of the ripened field; and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thro&rsquo; their cheerful band the rural
talk<br />
The rural scandal, and the rural jest,<br />
Fled harmless.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the traveller and the poet, such scenes afford an ample
field for amusement; but waving corn is ill adapted to the
canvass of the painter.&nbsp; About two miles from Oswestry, we
passed through the little town of</p>
<h3>WHITTINGTON.</h3>
<p>At this place was fought the battle between Oswald, the
Christian King of the Northumbrians, and P&egrave;nda, the Pagan
King of the Mercians, in which the former lost his life.&nbsp; An
easy walk soon brought us to</p>
<h3><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>OSWESTRY.</h3>
<p>Its only relicks now remaining are the ruins of a chapel,
built over a remarkably fine spring of water; to this was
formerly attributed the cure of various diseases, incident both
to man and beast; and though its miracles have long ceased, yet
it still bears the name of the saint.&nbsp; The remains of the
castle, supposed to have been built at the time of the conquest,
are now almost too trivial to be noticed.&nbsp; This town was
garrisoned by the King, in the beginning of the civil wars, but
captured in June, 1644, by the Earl of Denbigh and General
Mytton.</p>
<p>In passing through the town of Oswestry, we noticed the
church, as being a very neat building; but either from our own
neglect, or imagining it not to be ancient, we did not inspect
the interior.&nbsp; Oswestry suffered greatly by fire, in the
year 1542, and likewise in 1567.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The chirk of St. Oswalde (says Leland) is a
very faire leddid chirch with a great tourrid steple, but it
standith without the New Gate; so that no chirch is there within
the towne.&nbsp; This chirch was some <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>time a monasterie, caullid the
<i>White Minster</i>.&nbsp; After turnid to a paroche chirch, and
the personage impropriate to the abbey of Shreusbyri.&nbsp; The
cloister stoode in hominum memoria ubi monumenta
monachorum.&nbsp; The place and streate wer the chirch standithe
is caullid Stretllan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this place to</p>
<h3>LLANYMYNACH,</h3>
<p>a continuation of the rich enclosed country, shewing to
advantage the agriculture of these parts, attended us, till we
reached the foot of the hill of Llanymynach.&nbsp; From the
summit of this we enjoyed a most beautiful and boundless
prospect, commanding the whole dome of the sky: all individual
dignity was overpowered by the immensity of the whole view, which
consisted more particularly of the rivers Virnwy and Tannad,
joining their waters with the Severn; the lofty water-fall of
Pistyll Rhaiadr&mdash;the Breddin hills&mdash;and the Ferwyn
mountains.&nbsp; The geological observations on Llanymynach hill,
by Mr. Aikin, are so accurate, that to attempt any further
description would be deemed highly presumptuous in me; I shall
therefore avail myself of an account, so ably delineated:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;The hill of Llanymynach, is not only remarkable
for the fine prospect from its top, it is still more worthy
notice, as containing by far the most extensive <i>lime-works</i>
of any in this part of the country.&nbsp; The lime of Llanymynach
rock is in high request as a manure, and is sent by land carriage
as far as Montgomery, New-town, and even Llanidloes: it sells at
the kilns for seven-pence a bushel, and from thirty to thirty-six
bushels, are reckoned a waggon-load; the coal with which it is
burnt, is brought partly from the neighbourhood of Oswestry, and
partly from Sir Watkin Williams Wynne&rsquo;s pits, near
Ruaben.&nbsp; The lime lies in strata, parallel to the horizon,
varying in thickness from three inches to five feet; it is of an
extraordinary hardness, with but little calcarious spar, and few
shells, or other marine exuvial; its colour reddish brown,
burning to almost white.&nbsp; Between the strata of lime, we
found a very tenacious smooth clay, orange coloured ochre, and
green plumose carbonate of copper, or malachite.&nbsp; It was in
search of this copper, that the Romans carried on here such
extensive works, of which the remains are still very visible:
they consist of a range of from twenty to thirty shallow pits,
the heaps of rubbish from the mouths of which, abound with small
pieces of copper ore, and a cave of considerable dimensions,
terminating in an irregular winding <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>passage, of unknown length,
connected with which, are two air shafts still remaining open,
and the appearances of several others, now filled up: in some of
these caverns are found, large and beautiful specimens of
stalactite.&nbsp; One of the levels was explored some years ago,
and in it was discovered a skeleton, with mining tools, and some
Roman copper coins.&nbsp; The whole mass of the hill, seems more
or less impregnated with copper: whenever the surface is
uncovered, there are evident marks of the presence of this metal,
and the stones composing the rampart of Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, which
encompasses two sides of the hill, are in many parts quite
covered with <i>cupreous efflorenscences</i>.&nbsp; Between the
village and the rock, passes a branch of the Ellesmere canal,
which, when navigable, will add much to the value of these works,
by rendering them more accessible to the surrounding country, and
may induce some spirited adventurer, to recommence a search after
copper, which, it is evident, was formerly prosecuted with
considerable success.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This description of Llanymynach hill, we pronounce from our
own observation, to be so very accurate, that the length of the
quotation will be readily excused.&nbsp; Leaving the pretty
village of Llanymynach, situated on the banks of the Virnwy, we
resumed our <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>journey to Welch Pool; the face of the country was
pleasing, and we soon reached the Breddin hills, on whose summit
a column is erected to commemorate the victory of Admiral Lord
Rodney over the French, in the year 1782.&nbsp; Not far from
hence, we passed a handsome aqueduct, admirably constructed over
the river Virnwy, of great strength and stability.&nbsp; The vale
of the Severn affords much picturesque scenery, and we at length
arrived at</p>
<h3>WELCH POOL</h3>
<p>Quay, about three miles from that place; several vessels were
lying here, which carry on a constant traffic with Worcester, and
the towns situated on the banks of this noble river.&nbsp; Before
our entr&egrave; into Pool, Powis Castle appeared on an eminence,
immediately rising behind the town, and beautifully backed with a
large plantation of trees.</p>
<p>Welch Pool derives its name from a black pool in its
neighbourhood; its Welch appellation signifying, a quagmire or
pool, and is one of the five boroughs in Montgomeryshire, which
jointly send a member to parliament.&nbsp; The town is by no
means neat; it stands on a low hill, and consists of one
principal street; in <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>which are situated the new county
hall, and market-places.&nbsp; The Severn is navigable within
three quarters of a mile of this town, and computed not less than
two hundred miles from its juncture with the Bristol
Channel.&nbsp; It is the great market for the Welch flannel,
called <i>gwart</i>, or webb, prepared in many parts of
Merionethshire, and generally used for soldiers&rsquo;
clothes.&nbsp; This trade, however, has of late been very
inconsiderable.</p>
<p>Powis Castle lies to the right, about one mile from Pool, on
the ridge of a rock, retaining a mixture of castle and mansion:
it is built of red stone, and originally contained within its
walls two castles: the entrance is between two round
towers.&nbsp; There are several family portraits in a long
gallery, measuring one hundred and seventeen feet by twenty: <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a> it was formerly one hundred and
sixty-seven feet long, but an apartment has been taken out of one
end. <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; The gardens still retain that
stiff formality, so much in vogue many years ago; but the curious
water-works, in imitation of the wretched taste of St.
Germain&rsquo;s en Laye, are now <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>destroyed.&nbsp; The prospect from
the castle is very extensive, comprehending a view of Welch Pool,
Vale, and Freiddin Hills.</p>
<p>From hence to</p>
<h3>MONTGOMERY,</h3>
<p>the Ellesmere Canal accompanied us part of the way; and at
length, after a fatiguing walk, we reached the Green Dragon, a
small and comfortable inn.&nbsp; The scite of Montgomery is very
pleasing, on a gentle ascent, and backed by a steep hill,
beautifully clothed with the rich plantations belonging to Lord
Powis.&nbsp; The town itself is a straggling place, and little to
recommend it.&nbsp; The remains of the castle are now too
trifling, to interest the passing traveller.</p>
<p>In the year 1094, this castle was gallantly defended by the
Normans; but the Welch, at last, finding meant to undermine the
walls, took it by storm; and, after putting the garrison to the
sword, levelled that fortress to the ground.&nbsp; It was
afterwards rebuilt by Henry III. in the year 1221, as a check to
the incursions of the Welch; but a second time razed to the
ground by Llewellyn the Great, Prince of Wales; it afterwards <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>became the
seat of the Lords Herbert of Cherbury, and their ancestors, till
reduced to its present ruinous condition by the civil wars.</p>
<p>The road to</p>
<h3>BISHOPS CASTLE,</h3>
<p>brought us through a very rich country; and on ascending a
hill, about five miles from Montgomery, a retrospect of the far
distant mountainous country of Wales, to which we were now
bidding a last adieu, irresistibly brought on a train of serious
reflections.&nbsp; In a retrospect like this, where the subject
and the scene must inspire serious thoughts, such traces are not
unpleasing; they tend to promote one general effect&mdash;the
love of contemplation.&nbsp; We enumerated the little incidents
which had taken place, indulging reflections on scenes for ever
past:&mdash;we erected, on the spot which we esteemed most
adapted to retirement, the visionary cottage: our schemes were
instantly arranged,&mdash;fancy fashioned its ornaments, adapted
its appendages;&mdash;and fancy will ever exceed realities.&nbsp;
But all our air-built plans of future happiness soon
vanished:&mdash;and alas! when</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&mdash;&ldquo;fancy scatters roses all around,<br />
What blissful visions rise!&nbsp; In prospect bright<br />
Awhile they charm the foul: but scarce attain&rsquo;d,<br />
The gay delusion fades.&nbsp; Another comes,<br />
The soft enchantment is again renew&rsquo;d,<br />
And youth again enjoys the airy dreams<br />
Of fancied good.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bishops Castle is situated in a bottom: we found it a more
extensive place than we had any idea of expecting; but being
shortly convinced, that there was nothing particular to require a
long stay, and having recruited ourselves at the Castle Inn, we
hastened to leave the town.&nbsp; The road, for the first seven
miles, continually dipped into shallow vallies, well wooded,
affording cursory views, with many a substantial farmer&rsquo;s
habitation lurking amongst the trees.&nbsp; At length, a rich and
noble vale, with extensive woods, on our right, animated with
several gentlemen&rsquo;s seats, and watered by an overflowing
stream, running immediately close to the road, accompanied us
to</p>
<h3>LUDLOW;</h3>
<p>situated on an eminence, in the midst of this most luxuriant
country.&nbsp; After the many indifferent Welch towns which we
had passed through, since the commencement <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>of our
pedestrian excursion, we felt ourselves not a little chagrined at
our uncouth appearance, in entering so gay a place.&nbsp; The
streets are commodious, and the houses and public buildings
extremely neat.&nbsp; The gravel walks round the castle are
extensive, and command, at occasional points, distinct prospects
of the gentlemen&rsquo;s seats, in the neighbourhood, with their
grounds, and noble plantations.&nbsp; The river Teme gives
additional beauty to this fascinating spot; the new bridge,
recently erected a little below the castle, forms likewise, from
this spot, by no means an uninteresting object; add to this, at
suitable distances, the river, by means of dams, is formed into
small artificial cascades.&nbsp; At the extremity of the town, is
another bridge, separating the counties of Shropshire and
Hereford.&nbsp; These walks were laid out in the year 1772, by
the Countess of Powis, at a great expence.&nbsp; The
overshadowing trees not only afford refreshing shelter from a
summer&rsquo;s sun, but are likewise a protection from the
piercing winter&rsquo;s wind: indeed,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&ldquo;I cou&rsquo;d
rove<br />
At morn, at noon, at eve, by lunar ray,<br />
In each returning season, through your shade,<br />
Ye reverend woods; cou&rsquo;d visit ev&rsquo;ry dell,<br />
Each hill, each breezy lawn, each wand&rsquo;ring brook,<br />
And bid the world admire; each magic spot again<br />
Cou&rsquo;d seek, and tell again of all its charms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Towards the North, the mazy course of the
Teme.&mdash;Oakley Park, the elegant seat of the Dowager Lady
Clive.&mdash;The Clee Hills.&mdash;The celebrated Caer Caradoc,
with the other eminences, near Stretton, terminating the view,
present a most fascinating landscape.&nbsp; Towards the West, a
combination of rock, wood, and water, gratifies the warmest wish
of fancy.</p>
<p>The Whitecliffe, opposite to the castle, and Hackluyt&rsquo;s
Close, near the Leominster road, are the two other most favourite
walks; but that round the castle is resorted to, as the most
fashionable promenade.</p>
<p>The town of Ludlow has been calculated to contain seven
hundred and two houses, and nearly three thousand five hundred
and sixty-five persons. <a name="citation166"></a><a
href="#footnote166" class="citation">[166]</a>&nbsp; The public
buildings are, the Market-house, the Guildhall, the Prison,
called Goalford&rsquo;s Tower, and the Cross: the rooms over the
latter, are dedicated for the instruction of thirty poor boys,
and fifteen poor girls; and the former, at a proper age, are
apprenticed <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>out.&nbsp; The town enjoys no particular manufactory,
but its chief trade consists in the article of gloves.</p>
<p>The castle, the palace of the Prince of Wales, in right of his
principality, is now entirely in ruins, except Mortimer&rsquo;s
tower, which was repaired by Sir Henry Sidney, during his
presidency: it is now inhabited by an old servant of Lord
Powis&rsquo;s, a very civil and intelligent man, who related,
with the utmost concern, the sad vicissitudes this castle had
experienced; he insisted on our entering the tower of his
habitation, and ascending the crumbling stairs, for a full
display of the various beauties in the vicinity of Ludlow, he
expatiated much on a valuable diamond ring, which he had
discovered <i>himself</i>, when attempting to drain a cellar; the
inscription of Hebrew characters, round the gold, within the
ring, was interpreted by the <i>larned</i>, &ldquo;A good
heart;&rdquo; this, and several coins of silver and gold, which
were found at the same time, are now in the possession of Lord
Powis: near the same spot, a number of skeletons were likewise
dug up.&nbsp; He next conducted us to a small room in this tower,
to observe an old stone placed over the fire-place, with a cross;
the letters W. S. and the date 1575, engraven on it.</p>
<p>Over the South-east gateway, leading into the interior <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>of the
castle, are the arms of Elizabeth, Queen of England, and beneath,
those of the Sydney family, with the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

</blockquote>
<p>This castle, founded by Roger de Montgomery, on a rock, in the
North-east angle of the town, supposed to be in the year 1112,
was considerably enlarged by Sir Henry Sydney.&nbsp; Its ancient
British name, <i>Dinan Llys Tywysog</i>, signifies the
<i>Prince&rsquo;s Palace</i>.&nbsp; The vicissitudes of war have
frequently been exemplified in this castle; it has had its Lords
and its Princes; it has been plundered, captured, dismantled, and
repaired, in those periods of civil warfare, which this
unfortunate country, in former times, continually
experienced.&nbsp; Philips, in &ldquo; The History and
Antiquities of Shrewsbury,&rdquo; during those melancholy
troubles, gives some account of this castle.&nbsp; Some
historians affirm, that Edward V. and his brother, were born in
Ludlow Castle; but others, not crediting this assertion,
attribute their birth to Wigmore: certain, however, it is, that
during their <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>minority, they here held their court, under the tuition
of Lord Anthony Woodville, and Lord Scales, till they were
removed to London, and soon after smothered in the Tower, by the
command of their cruel and ambitious uncle, the Duke of
Gloucester.&nbsp; Here, likewise, Prince Arthur, the eldest son
of Henry VII. celebrated his marriage with the virtuous Catharine
of Arragon; and in 1502, he here paid the debt of nature, and was
buried in the cathedral church of Worcester.</p>
<p>The account of the representation, at Ludlow, of
Milton&rsquo;s celebrated Mask of Comus, is thus mentioned in the
Life of that poet, prefixed to Newton&rsquo;s edition: &ldquo;It
was in the year 1634, that his Mask was presented at Ludlow
Castle.&nbsp; There was formerly a president of Wales, and a sort
of a court kept at Ludlow, which has since been abolished; and
the president, at that time, was the Earl of Bridgwater, before
whom Milton&rsquo;s Mask was presented, on Michaelmas night; and
the principal parts, those of the Two Brothers, were performed by
his Lordship&rsquo;s sons, the Lord Brackly, and Mr. Thomas
Egerton; and that of the Lady, by his Lordship&rsquo;s daughter,
the Lady Alice Egerton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first year of William and Mary, the presidency <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>was
dissolved by act of parliament, &ldquo;being a great grievance to
the subject, and a means to introduce an arbitrary power,
especially in the late reign, when a new convert family were at
the head of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church next demanded our attention, the only one belonging
to this town.&nbsp; The time of the foundation of this ancient
and elegant structure cannot now be strictly ascertained: it is
situated on an eminence, in the centre of the town.&nbsp; The
square tower is lofty, and of very light architecture, but the
upper part suffered much, by the all-destroying hand of Oliver
Cromwell.&nbsp; The highly-finished statues round the
battlements, are much mutilated, and many entirely
destroyed.&nbsp; On entering the church, six light Gothic fluted
arches on each side, with four similar ones of larger dimensions,
supporting the tower, are strikingly grand.&nbsp; Under the
organ-loft, we passed into the chancel, now only made use of, for
the administration of the sacrament.&nbsp; This is a most elegant
building, with thirteen stalls on each side, similar, in stile,
to the generality of cathedrals; the seats of the stalls, all of
which turn back, exhibit specimens of curious workmanship, with
strange devices, and ridiculous conceits.&nbsp; Some of the glass
painted windows are still in good preservation; the large one,
over the altar-piece, represents the History of St. Lawrence, to
whom this church is dedicated, in <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>fifty-four compartments.&nbsp; The
other windows of the chancel are much mutilated, collected from
different parts of the church, and several panes broken, by the
unmeaning idleness of boys;&mdash;regardless of these valuable
relicks of antiquity.&mdash;In the side of the wall, near the
altar, are two stone stalls, with a piscina opposite.</p>
<p>In this chancel is a handsome monument, erected to the memory
of Robert Townsend, and his wife, with several figures of their
sons and daughters carved round the bottom: over them are the
arms of their family and connexions: it bears the date of
1581.</p>
<p>A modern monument to Theophilus Solway, Esq.</p>
<p>An ancient one to Ambrosia Sydney, who died at Ludlow
Castle.&nbsp; This lady was daughter to Sir Henry Sidney, who
attained the important situation of the Presidency of Wales, in
the year 1564.&nbsp; He died at Bewdley, 1584, and left this
singular injunction to his executors: &ldquo;that his heart
should be buried at Shrewsbury, his bowels at Bewdley, and his
body at Ludlow, in the tomb of his favourite daughter
Ambrosia:&rdquo; this order was punctually executed; and the
leaden urn, containing his heart, was six inches deep, and five
inches in diameter at the top, with this inscription carved three
times round it:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span><span class="smcap">Her lith the Harte of Syr Henrye
Sydney</span> L. P.&nbsp; <i>Anno Domini</i>, 1586.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an engraving of this urn, taken from a drawing of Mr. S.
Nicholas, see the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine for September,
1794.</p>
<p>Another monument <a name="citation172a"></a><a
href="#footnote172a" class="citation">[172a]</a> to Edward
Wetson, and his wife, kneeling opposite to each other.</p>
<p>In a small chapel, to the left of the chancel, are three very
handsome painted glass-windows, containing the history of the
Apostles, in eighteen compartments; there is also a rosary.</p>
<p>In this chapel is an elegant marble tomb, to Sir Thomas
Bridgeman, serjeant at law.&nbsp; In this church is likewise
buried Sir John Bridgeman, the last president but one of Ludlow
Castle.&nbsp; He was extremely rigid in his office: and one Ralph
Gittins, who had probably experienced his severity, composed the
following epitaph on him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies Sir John Bridgeman, clad in his
clay;<br />
God said to the Devil, sirrah, take him away.&rdquo; <a
name="citation172b"></a><a href="#footnote172b"
class="citation">[172b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>A
chapel corresponding on the opposite side, contains the royal
arms of Charles, and several old iron armoury.</p>
<p>Should the tourist find time to make any stay at Ludlow,
several excursions in the neighbourhood, will prove highly
gratifying.&nbsp; Oakley Park, the elegant seat of the Dowager
Lady Clive, claims the greatest attention; it is situated about
two miles from Ludlow, on the banks of the Teme river; just
beyond this, is a seat of &mdash; Walpole, Esq.&nbsp; About five
miles is Downton Castle; the noble mansion, and fine walks of
Richard Payne Knight, Esq. one of the representatives in
Parliament for the borough of Ludlow.&nbsp; Being necessitated to
leave this charming country by a particular day, we had no
opportunity of visiting these celebrated, and much admired
seats.</p>
<p>With regret we left the fascinating situation of Ludlow, and
crossing Lawford&rsquo;s Bridge, we ascended an eminence, along a
fine beautiful terrace, commanding a most charming, and pleasant
country to our left, with the fertile county of Hereford,
abundant with orchards, which were all bending with the produce
of the year.&nbsp; About two miles from Ludlow on the right, we
paused to admire the delightful seat of Theophilus Richard
Solway, Esq. situated on an eminence, and skirted by a rich
plantation of wood, <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>towards the West: it is called the
Lodge.&nbsp; Descending into a bottom, a rich country, studded
with farm-houses, soon brought us to the town of</p>
<h3>LEOMINSTER,</h3>
<p>or Lemister, consisting of one long street; the Market-place
in the centre, bearing a very old date, and likewise the church,
are both deserving of the traveller&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; It is
situated in a flat, and the country round it not particularly
interesting.</p>
<p>From hence, a turnpike-road, shewing to advantage, the rich
culture of the country, soon brought us within sight of the
venerable cathedral of</p>
<h3>HEREFORD,</h3>
<p>backed by a sloping eminence just rising behind, and
beautifully clothed with wood.&nbsp; Being under a particular
engagement to meet a party at Ross, to accompany us down the Wye
the following day, time would not allow us to investigate this
respectable city, so minutely, as it deserves.&nbsp; Our
observations therefore, were so cursory, that &ldquo;The Hereford
Guide,&rdquo; must <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>supply the deficiences in this part of our journal;
this neglect, the tourist must attribute to our delay at the
engaging town of Ludlow.</p>
<p>At Hereford, we for some time hesitated respecting the hire of
a boat to convey us to Ross; but the exorbitant demand of the
boatmen soon determined us to pursue the turnpike-road, and
follow, as near as possible, the course of the Wye.&nbsp; The
orchards were overcharged with &ldquo;bending fruit,&rdquo; and
seemed to prognosticate a more favourable cyder season, than has
of late been experienced.&nbsp; The retrospect of the city, with
its ancient cathedral, formed a most attracting view; and about
three miles, a most lovely vale, bounded by the hills of South
Wales, arrested our attention.&nbsp; A continuation of the same
scenery of orchards, in which Herefordshire so peculiarly
abounds, with the road continually dipping into shallow vallies,
attended us within five miles of Ross, when, ascending a steep
hill, a view of that town, or, rather, of its far conspicuous
spire, broke in upon the reposing character of the scene.&nbsp;
This presently conducted us to Wilton Bridge, thrown over the
Wye, about half a mile from the town; and, leaving the castle of
Wilton to the left, ascended the town of</p>
<h3><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>ROSS,</h3>
<p>to the inn, so celebrated as the original habitation of Mr.
Kyrle; but more generally known by the name of &ldquo;The Man of
Ross.&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlord seems rather to depend upon the
custom of strangers, from this circumstance, than the
accommodations the inn offers.&nbsp; On the bridge we paused a
short time, to take a view of the meandering Vaga, which here
considerably widens; several pleasure-boats, of various
construction, were riding at anchor, and united to enliven the
watry scene, whilst its smooth tranquil surface, reflected and
reverted every object situated on the bank.</p>
<p>The life and character of Mr. Kyrle has too often been
insisted on, and too frequently celebrated in verse, to be again
repeated, unless to &ldquo;point its moral to the heart;&rdquo;
teaching us, that self-approbation can confer an inward
happiness, superior to all worldly applause; for,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What nothing earthly gives, or can
destroy;<br />
The soul&rsquo;s calm sunshine, and the heart-felt joy,<br />
Is virtue&rsquo;s prize.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a bustle pervaded the whole town, of parties assembling
here, for an aquatic expedition to Monmouth, <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>the
following day, that with difficulty we obtained a small room:
from this circumstance, it would be advisable for parties to
secure themselves accommodations during the summer-months, a
considerable time beforehand, such is the continued assemblage of
parties forming for the Wye: a boat likewise should be hired, and
by mentioning the number of your party, the landlord will be a
proper judge, respecting the size.&nbsp; Strangers may pass, with
pleasure, the greatest part of a day, in surveying the views in
the vicinity of Ross; views, which must gratify the most
superficial observer; but more particularly from the
church-yard.&nbsp; A walk through the latter place to &ldquo;The
Prospect,&rdquo; so called from the profuse variety of objects,
in the beautiful, and the sublime, which are presented from this
spot.&nbsp; The sudden burst of such a collection of beauties,
the eye, indeed, cannot contain without gratification.&nbsp; The
river below bends itself, in the whimsical and fantastical shape
of a horse-shoe: this singular wind of the river&mdash;the ruins
of Wilton Castle&mdash;the luxuriant counties of Hereford and
Monmouth, and the beautiful Chase Woods, all combine to promote
one peculiarly grand and beautiful effect.&nbsp; To enter into a
minute description of objects, so various and extensive, is
impossible: in fine, to delineate the beauties of the Vaga, with
all its accompaniments, would be enumerating every object that is
interesting in Nature.&nbsp; Having sufficiently pored <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>over the
view from the Prospect, a ramble through the meadows will next
prove highly pleasing.</p>
<p>The situation of Ross, though exceedingly beautiful, has
nothing in itself to detain attention: the streets narrow, dirty,
and inconvenient.&nbsp; The castle of Wilton, situated on the
banks of the Wye, was founded in the reign of Henry I.; it was
formerly a nunnery, from whence the Greys de Wilton derive their
title.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, we congratulated each other on the
favourableness of the weather, and with good spirits provided all
the necessaries requisite for our water expedition; the enjoyment
of which depends much on the season.&nbsp; The hire of the boat
to Monmouth, by water, is one pound eleven shillings and
six-pence, not including ten shillings for provisions for the
men, who likewise expect an additional small sum, after the
fatigues of the day.&nbsp; The boat, navigated by three men, will
contain ten or twelve people, without any inconvenience, and is
properly protected by an awning, from the heat of the sun.&nbsp;
The distance from Ross to Chepstow, by water, is more than forty
miles, which strangers occasionally accomplish in one day; but
this hurrying method will not allow them an opportunity of
inspecting, with proper attention, the various objects which
deserve to be noticed; and they cannot possibly <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>find time
to leave their boat, and climb the rugged, steep banks of the
Wye, in search of views, which, though visited by the discerning
few, yet merit the regard of every amateur of nature&rsquo;s
landscapes: and here it may not be improper to mention, the
boatmen, from laziness, too frequently suffer these most
interesting spots to be passed unnoticed by strangers, merely to
avoid the delay of a few minutes.&nbsp; Gilpin, in his excellent
treatise, &ldquo;The Observations on the River Wye,&rdquo; thus
analyzes, in the second section, the beauties of the
&ldquo;echoing Vaga,&rdquo; and divides its constituent parts
into&mdash;the <i>steepness</i> of its banks&mdash;its
<i>mazy</i> course&mdash;the <i>ground</i>, <i>woods</i>, and
<i>rocks</i>, which are its native ornaments&mdash;and, lastly,
the <i>buildings</i>.&nbsp; To this he might with propriety have
added, its <i>echoes</i>&mdash;the <i>variety of views</i> from
its banks&mdash;the fishing <i>coracles</i>, which are
continually on the river; for all these contribute to form one
pleasing and interesting effect.</p>
<p>We embarked on board our boat, a little below the town; and
the first object which drew our attention, was the ivy-mantled
walls of Wilton: the annual growth of the few trees which
encircle it, will, in time, render it a more picturesque object;
it is at present so sufficiently seen from the water, as not to
require the stranger to disembark for farther inspection.&nbsp; A
few yards below, we passed under Wilton Bridge, communicating <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the roads
from Hereford to Ross: it is an elegant structure, of several
arches.&nbsp; From hence, for four or five miles, the banks are
tame and uninteresting, and so high above the river, as to
prevent a prospect of the adjacent country; but a group of
cattle, some ruminating on the brink, some browzing on the
ashlings, which overhung the stream, and others</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;from their sides,<br />
The troublous insects lashing with their tails;<br />
Returning still,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>formed a &ldquo;rural confusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The velocity of
the stream shortly brought us to that noble scenery, about four
miles from Ross, which so eminently distinguishes and constitutes
the beauty of the Wye; before us, the noble remains of Goodrich
Castle, cresting a steep eminence, enveloped with trees,
presented themselves; behind, the thick foliage of Chase Woods
closed the picture.&nbsp; The happiest gradation of tints, and
the liveliest blending of colours, was here conspicuous.&nbsp; On
the right hand we landed on the shore, in order to make a minute
investigation of the castle: it is certainly a grand ruin, and
stands on an eminence, naturally so steep, as to render it, in
former times, capable of some resistance against a formidable
enemy.&nbsp; On our first entrance into the ruin, we naturally
indulged reflections on past scenes, contemplated the traces of
ancient splendour; <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>and connecting what remains, with what is destroyed; we
pondered on the vanity of human art, and the ravages of time,
which exhibit, in this ruin, their compleatest triumph.&nbsp; The
warrior, who strove to preserve its original grandeur against the
attacks of Cromwell, is buried in Walford church, situated on the
opposite side of the river, and seen from the castle.&nbsp; The
different parts of the building, bear evident marks of its having
been erected at various times; from a seat in the castle-yard is
the most advantageous spot for surveying, in one view, the whole
of this ruin: an octagon pillar, of light and elegant
workmanship, is seen to great advantage through the gate-way, and
adds considerably to the magnificence of this ancient pile: it
now belongs to Dr. Griffin, of Hadnuck, the lord of the
manor.&nbsp; To return to our boat: we took a different and more
circuitous route, for the purpose of inspecting the remains of
Goodrich Priory, now converted into a farm.&nbsp; The chapel has
experienced the same vicissitude; and those walls, which formerly
re-echoed with the chaunting of voices, and the solemn peal, now
repeat the continued strokes of the flail; in many parts of the
walls, the initials of names of persons, who have long since paid
the debt of nature, and left behind no other memorial, are carved
with characteristic rudeness, shewing, to every passing stranger,
the prevalency of that universal passion&mdash;the love of
fame.&nbsp; The Gothic windows, and <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>the cross, erected on each end of
the building, shew evident marks of its former purpose.&nbsp; The
boat usually meets the passengers at another reach of the river;
but it is a plan by no means to be pursued; since, by missing a
circuit round the castle, its different tints, and variety of
attitudes, occasioned by one of the boldest sweeps of the Wye,
are entirely lost.&nbsp; A short time after we had taken our last
retrospect of Goodrich Castle, the spire of Ruredean church
appeared in front, just peeping from among the woody skirts of
the Forest of Dean: a little below, Courtfield House, belonging
to Mr. Vaughn, was seen, in a very picturesque point of view,
with the ruins of the chapel, forming the back ground.&nbsp; In
Courtfield House, tradition reports, the warlike Henry V. was
nursed; and in the church of Welch Buckner, situated to the
right, in a noble amphitheatre, enclosed with rocks, first
embraced the Christian religion.&nbsp; A busy scene, of craft
loading and unloading, and coals shipping for various parts from
the quay at Lidbroke, presents a picture of cheerful activity,
and forms a pleasing contrast to the quiet, rich, and retired
spots, we had left behind us; such spots, as were well adapted to
form the mind of Britain&rsquo;s glory&mdash;the virtuous
Henry.&nbsp; The banks now became richly clothed with wood, from
the summits of the highest rocks to the water&rsquo;s edge; and a
hill in front, called Rosemary Topping, from the mellow <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>luxuriance
of its sides, closed the prospect.&nbsp; Almost every sweep
presents a new object, to strike the admiration of the spectator:
the transitions are sudden, but never so harsh as to disgust;
even the contrast between the embellishments of art we had just
left, and the wild rocks, which here exhibit nature in her most
striking attitudes, give an additional impression to each
other.</p>
<p>We now reached those fine mass of rocks, called Coldwell, one
of which, Symond&rsquo;s Yatch, to the left, it is customary for
company to ascend, in order to view the mazy and circuitous
course of the river, and the extensive prospect around.&nbsp; The
Forest of Dean, the counties of Monmouth, Hereford, and
Gloucester, were extended before us, studded with villages,
diversified with clusters of half-visible farm houses; with many
a grey steeple, &ldquo;embosomed high in tufted
trees.&rdquo;&nbsp; In painting the several views from this
summit, the happiest description would fail; the impression can
only be conveyed by the eye.&nbsp; The river here makes a most
extraordinary winding round the promontory, and having completed
a circuit of more than five miles, flows a second time
immediately under Symond&rsquo;s Yatch.&nbsp; The whole of this
mazy course may be traced from this eminence.&nbsp; From hence we
discovered a very remarkable polysyllabical articulate echo, and
we reckoned twelve distinct reverberations from the <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>explosion
of a gun, fired on this spot.&nbsp; It is here again customary
for the boatmen to impose on strangers, and if they can prevail
on them, during their walk to Symond&rsquo;s Yatch, will take the
boat round the circuit of five miles, and meet them at New Wier,
in order that no time should be lost; but this laziness we by no
means encouraged, and the whole course of this extraordinary and
romantic sweep proved highly gratifying.&nbsp; Goodrich spire,
which we again wound round, presented itself; huge fragments of
massy rocks which have rolled down from the precipices, opposite
Manuck Farm, here almost choaked up the course of the
stream.&nbsp; The changing attitudes and various hues of
Symond&rsquo;s Yatch, lifting its almost spiral head high above
the other rocks, as we receded and drew near it, supplied a
combination of tints surprisingly gay and beautiful; and having
accomplished a sweep of five miles, we reached, within a quarter
of a mile, the spot where we began our ascent to this steep
eminence.</p>
<p>The view, at New Wier, next unfolded itself; but a
disagreeable scene here generally occurs, and interrupts the
pleasure of contemplation: a large assemblage of beggars, men,
women, and children, on the banks, bare-footed, and scarcely a
rag to cover them, followed our boat, imploring charity; and
several almost throwing themselves into the water, to catch <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>your money,
which, every now and then, the bigger seize from the less.&nbsp;
This idle crew subsist on the trifles they obtain from strangers;
and as beggary is their professed trade, if their wants are not
satisfied, they generally add insolence, with an oath, to their
demands.</p>
<p>But I have omitted to mention, that before we reached the New
Wier, the spire of Haunton on Wye, cresting a hill at the
extremity of a long reach, and a fantastic barren rock, jutting
out from the green foliage which encircles it, presenting itself
bold and conspicuous, formed prominent and interesting features
in the landscape: this is called &ldquo;Bearcroft,&rdquo;
receiving its appellation from the very respectable and learned
counsellor of that name.&nbsp; Several rocks indeed, particularly
in this part of the river, are named by the Council, who have
long made it a practice of exploring the rich and bold scenery of
the Wye, on their assize circuit.&nbsp; Gilpin, considering New
Wier as the second grand scene on the Wye, thus describes it:
&ldquo;The river is wider than usual in this part, and takes a
sweep round a towering promontory of rock, which forms the side
screen on the left, and is the grand feature of the
view.&mdash;On the right side of the river, the bank forms a
woody amphitheatre, following the course of the stream round the
promontory: <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>its lower skirts are adorned with a hamlet, in the
midst of which, volumes of thick smoke, thrown up at intervals,
from an iron forge, as its fires receive fresh fuel, add double
grandeur to the scene.&nbsp; But what peculiarly marks this view,
is a circumstance on the water: the whole river, at this place,
makes a precipitate fall; of no great height, indeed, but enough
to merit the name of a cascade, though to the eye, above the
stream, it is an object of no consequence.&nbsp; In all the
scenes we had yet passed, the water moving with a slow and solemn
pace, the objects around kept time, as it were, with it; and
every steep, and every rock, which hung over the river, was
solemn, tranquil, and majestic.&nbsp; But here, the violence of
the stream, and the roaring of the waters, impressed a new
character on the scene: all was agitation and uproar; and every
steep, and every rock, stared with wildness and
terror.&rdquo;&nbsp; The accuracy and elegancy of this
description, drawn by so masterly a pen, I hope, will amply
compensate for the length of this quotation.&nbsp; The extensive
iron-works, mentioned in this passage, belong to Mr.
Partridge.&nbsp; Below the New Wier, a continuation of the same
rich scenery still arrested our attention, and rocks and wood
seemed to contend, which should be most conspicuous; till the
winding of the river, round Doward&rsquo;s Rock, on which was
formerly a Roman station, brought us under <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>the house
of Mr. Hatley, which commands a view of the river as far as
Monmouth, when it is terminated by the town, and bridge of six
arches.&nbsp; As we drew near</p>
<h3>MONMOUTH,</h3>
<p>the house of Dr. Griffins, situated on an eminence, and a
banqueting room, erected by the inhabitants of the place,
appeared above the town, on the left.</p>
<p>The town of Monmouth lies too low, to form a grand appearance
from the water, but is, in itself, neat and well-built, and
pleasantly situated on the banks of the Wye.</p>
<p>As we repaired to our inn, we were both involuntarily led to
take a retrospect of the past amusements of the day.&nbsp; The
partial gleams of sunshine had given additional tints to the rich
and bold scenery, and every thing had conspired to render it a
most interesting aquatic excursion.&nbsp; The variety of scenes
which Claude would have selected, had he now existed, for his
canvas; with rapture, too, would he have caught the tints; and,
with the happiest effect, combined the objects into a picture,
kept up our attention, and removed <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>that monotony which too often
accompanies water excursions.&nbsp; Such has been the pleasure of
our first day&rsquo;s water expedition; and, from the impression
it made on us, we eagerly look forward to some future period,
when we may again retrace views, which memory will ever hold
dear, and the pleasure be then redoubled, with the remembrance of
past occurrences.</p>
<p>The evening we dedicated to the survey of
Monmouth.&mdash;Opposite the Beaufort Arms, the most convenient
inn in the town, is the town-house, handsomely built, with a full
length statue on the outside, facing the street, with this
inscription under it: &ldquo;Henry the Fifth, born at Monmouth,
August the ninth, 1387.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the birth of this warlike
and virtuous prince, the charter was granted to the town of
Monmouth: it is governed by a mayor, two bailiffs, fifteen
aldermen, nine constables, two serjeants, and two beadles.&nbsp;
The castle now bears few vestiges of its former grandeur; and of
the regal dome, scarcely a wreck has escaped, through the long
lapse of years, the ravages of time: where a mighty king once
gave audience, and where vassals knelt, now assemble the animate
appendages of a farm-yard.</p>
<p>Near the castle is a very antiquated house, now converted <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>into a
school, the property of the Duke of Beaufort.&nbsp; To this town
Wihenoc de Menemuc, or Monmouth, in the reign of Henry I. brought
over a convent of black Monks from St. Florence, and placed them
first in the church of St. Cadoc, near the castle, and after, in
the church of St. Mary.&nbsp; It was among other ancient
priories, and seized by the crown, during the wars with France;
but was restored again, made denison, and continued till the
general suppression, in the reign of Henry VIII. <a
name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a>&nbsp; From hence we walked to the
church-yard; close to which is the room where Geoffry of Monmouth
composed his well-known History: this is now a day-school.&nbsp;
Monmouth has likewise to boast of a free-school, founded here,
from the following curious circumstance: Mr. Jones, a native of
Newland, being in distress, left his parish and went to London,
where he engaged himself as servant to a Hamburgh merchant, and
proving trusty in his office, he was by degrees advanced, till at
length he attained a fortune of his own; willing to prove how far
the charity of his native place would extend towards him, in
disguise, he applied for that relief, which he was enabled to
shew towards others, but his parish taking no notice of him,
referred him to Monmouth, and would not redress his pretended
complaints: <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>the latter however, being more charitably disposed,
relieved him according to his wishes.&nbsp; Having thus proved
their generosity, he acquainted them of his real situation, and
promised to repay their kindness, by obliging them in any demand,
they should request.&nbsp; On this, they solicited the foundation
of a free-school, which he immediately built, liberally endowed,
and which from that time has been well supported.&nbsp; The walk
to the Folly, we were informed, would have afforded us some
beautiful and extensive prospects; the whole of this information
we should probably have found true, but the evening closing, we
were very reluctantly necessitated to return to our inn.</p>
<p>Early in the morning we renewed our survey of Monmouth: the
church first demanded notice: it is a handsome structure, but the
inside offers nothing remarkable for the inspection of the
antiquarian.&nbsp; The gaol, built after the plan of the
benevolent Howard, is situated in a healthy spot, and, in every
respect, rendered as commodious and comfortable, as such a place
will allow, for the unfortunate inhabitants.&nbsp; Monmouth,
indeed, contains several good houses, and the neighbourhood is
respectable.&nbsp; A bridge at the extremity of the town, with
the ancient gateway, bears every mark of antiquity.</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>The
hire of the boat, from Monmouth to Chepstow, is on the same plan
as from Ross to Monmouth, the distance being nearly equal.&nbsp;
Nothing now remained, but to recommence our water excursion; and
we accordingly embarked a quarter of a mile below the town, where
the river Monnow joins itself with the Wye; from hence
Monnow-mouth, or Monmouth.&nbsp; The weather still continued
favourable for our schemes: the banks on the left, were, at
first, low; but as we receded from the town, the spire of
Monmouth in the retrospect, with the Kemmin woods, rising from a
rock of great height, on our left, under which the river
meanders, engaged our attention; and to our right, Pen-y-van
hill, was the bold and rich scenery we enjoyed, on our first
re-embarkation.</p>
<p>The same scenery of rock, wood, and water, which so captivated
us yesterday, still continued, occasionally diversified by light
vessels skimming by our boat, and increasing in number, as we
approached nearer the sea.&nbsp; The rude hail of the boatmen, as
they passed, was re-echoed by the rocks, and the dingy white
sails of the vessels, which soon disappeared round some bold
promontory, were particularly picturesque.&nbsp; Coleman&rsquo;s
Rocks appeared alternately, mantled with underwood, and pointed
crags; large fragments scattered in the river, here divide the
counties of Monmouth and <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Gloucester.&nbsp; At Redbrooke
Hills, the curling smoke issuing from the iron-works, formed a
pleasing-accompaniment to the scenery, and the whole exhibited a
picture of industrious labour.&nbsp; These works belong to Mr.
Turner: the wood and meadow land of Whitebrook Hills, were finely
contrasted with the busy scene at Redbrooke.&nbsp; From hence a
long reach, with Fidenham Chase Hill rising conspicuously in the
front, brought us to the village of</p>
<h3>LLANDOGO;</h3>
<p>diversified with cottages, from the base to the highest summit
of the sloping eminence.&nbsp; This village is about nine miles
from Monmouth, and arrests particular observation; here vessels
of considerable burden were loading with iron, and other
commodities, for various ports.&nbsp; The appearance of the
river, here, changed; the translucent stream, which had hitherto
alternately reflected, as in a mirror, the awful projection of
the rocks, and the soft flowery verdure of its banks, was
affected, by the influence of the tide, and rendered turbid and
unpleasant to the sight.</p>
<p>A turn of the river soon brought us to the village of</p>
<h3><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>TINTERN:</h3>
<p>we here observed the ruins of an old mansion, belonging to Mr.
Farmer, of Monmouth; this house appears of an old date, and might
probably claim the attention of the curious antiquary, was he not
so wrapt up in contemplating the venerable Abbey, which presents
its Gothic pile, in solemn majesty.&nbsp; This august building,
great in ruins, and awfully grand in appearance, impels the
stranger, as it were, imperceptibly, to land and inspect its
noble arches, its tottering pillars, and its highly finished
windows; the specimens of ancient architecture, which formerly
were delicately wrought by the hand of art, are now finely decked
by that of nature.&nbsp; On our first entrance, our attention was
too much engrossed, to exchange the mutual communication of
thought; but the care which has been officiously taken to remove
every fragment, lying scattered through the immense area of the
fabric, and the smoothness of the shorn grass, which no scythe
should have dared to clip, in a great measure perverts the
character of the ruin: these circumstances but ill accord with
the mutilated walls of an ancient ruin, which has braved the
pitiless storms of so many centuries.&nbsp; In this respect, we
by no means agreed with Gilpin, who <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>thus describes it: &ldquo;We
excuse&mdash;perhaps we approve&mdash;the neatness that is
introduced within.&nbsp; It <i>may</i> add to the <i>beauty</i>
of the scene&mdash;to its <i>novelty</i> it undoubtedly
<i>does</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when this disgust was a little
abated, we indulged those reflections, which scenes of ancient
grandeur naturally recall.</p>
<p>This beautiful ruin is cruciform, measuring two hundred and
thirty feet in length, and thirty-three in breadth; the transept
stretches north and south, one hundred and sixty feet. <a
name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194"
class="citation">[194]</a>&nbsp; This cistertian abbey was
founded by Walter de Clare, in the year 1131, and dedicated to
St. Mary, in the reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp; It experienced the
same fate with many other monasteries, and was granted, at its
dissolution, to the Earl of Worcester, in the year 1537.</p>
<p>As we receded from the banks, Tintern Abbey, with the Gothic
fret-work of the eastern window, seemingly bound together by the
treillage of ivy, appeared in the most pleasing point of view;
sloping hills and rich woods forming a fine back-ground.&nbsp; As
we drew nearer</p>
<h3><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>CHEPSTOW,</h3>
<p>some most noble rocks, &ldquo;nature&rsquo;s proud
bastions,&rdquo; opened upon us, to the left, grander than any we
had hitherto admired, and which, we had previously determined,
were inconceivably fine, and surpassed any idea we had formed of
the channel of this romantic river: to add to the magnificence of
the whole, the setting sun tinged the rocks with the most
resplendent colours, and the dewy freshness of the evening
improved the charm of the scene; the one enchanting the sense,
the other refreshing it.&nbsp; The lofty Wine Cliff, to the
right, and Piercefield, with the curious projecting rocks, called
the Twelve Apostles, and Peter&rsquo;s Thumb, heighten, to the
very extent of beauty, this noble scene, gratifying, beyond
measure, to the admirer of nature.&nbsp; Another reach brought us
in sight of Chepstow Castle, on a prominent rock, of which it
seemed to form a part; noble in situation, and grand in
appearance.&nbsp; The singular constructed bridge, the rocks, and
the scarce visible town, here made a most charming picture: this
we enjoyed exceedingly, but regretted a few more minutes would
set us on shore, and conclude our excursion on the Wye; an
excursion which, the farther we proceeded, the more we were
interested; and so <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>much so, as to determine a renewal of this pleasing
tour, another summer.&nbsp; The wooden bridge thrown over the
Wye, at this place, is of very singular construction; the boards
forming the flooring are all designedly loose, but prevented, by
pegs fattened at the extremity of them, from being carried away
by the tide, and by that ingenious contrivance gradually rise and
fall with it, which is here frequently known to rise to the
extraordinary height of seventy feet.</p>
<p>Not having visited the church, in consequence of the bad
weather, at the commencement of our tour, we determined now to
inspect it.&nbsp; The entrance, through the western door, is an
elegant specimen of Saxon architecture, richly wrought, with
three arches; in the inside is the monument of Sir Henry Martin,
one of the twelve judges, who presided at the condemnation of
Charles I. and was confined in the castle seven and twenty
years.</p>
<p>A curious carved one to the Marquis of Worcester and Lady,
though not buried here; and another, of the date 1620, to the
memory of Mrs. Clayton and her two husbands, both kneeling.</p>
<p>This church originally belonged to the alien Benedictine <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>priory of
Strigule, but converted, at the reformation, into the parish
church of Chepstow.</p>
<p>Admittance to the celebrated walks of Piercefield can only be
obtained on Tuesdays and Fridays.&nbsp; To survey these with that
attention which they deserve, occupy several hours; the liveliest
description cannot do justice to the rich and bold scenery, with
all its accompaniments; the eye can alone receive the impression,
for,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How long so e&rsquo;er the wanderer roves,
each step<br />
Shall wake fresh beauties, each short point presents<br />
A different picture; new, and yet the same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The winding of the precipice, (says Gilpin) is the
magical secret, by which all these enchanting scenes are
produced.&rdquo;&nbsp; At one point, both above and below, as far
as the eye can reach, rolls in majestic windings, the river Wye;
at another, the Severn, hastening to meet &ldquo;its sister
river,&rdquo; is discovered, till at last they are both lost in
the Bristol Channel; at another, these scenes are concealed, and
thick woods, apparently coeval with time itself, and a long range
of rock, burst upon &ldquo;the wanderer,&rdquo; with irresistible
beauty and attraction.&nbsp; The occasional recurrence also of
the rude bench, overshadowed by some umbrageous tree, and
concealed from the steep precipice below, by <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>thick
underwood, allow only glimpses of the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>The house has received great repairs, and elegantly furnished
by the present possessor, Colonel Wood.&nbsp; Every apartment,
indeed, has its appropriate embellishments.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have thus brought my Tour to a conclusion; a Tour, which has
been productive of much amusement, and, I hope, not entirely
devoid of advantage: it only remains, therefore, for me to add,
that the Two Friends, having completed a pedestrian circuit of
near eight hundred miles, parted with mutual regret, jointly
exclaiming,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Cambria</i>, as thy romantic vales
<i>we</i> leave,<br />
And bid farewell to each retiring hill,<br />
Where fond attention seems to linger still,<br />
Tracing the broad bright landscape; much <i>we</i> grieve,<br />
That, mingled with the toiling croud, no more<br />
<i>We may</i> return thy varied views to mark,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

199</span>ADDENDA.</h2>
<p><i>Page</i> <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page44">44</a></span>.&nbsp; The church of Tenby is a
large, handsome, and antique edifice, and several monuments,
bearing an ancient date, worthy of notice.</p>
<p>On the left of the altar, is one to William Rifam, with the
following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two hundred pounds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and 50 more<br />
He gave this towne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; to help the poore.</p>
<p>The use of one on cloth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and coles bestowe<br />
For twelve decrepid mean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and lowe.</p>
<p>Let 50 pounds to five<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; be yearly lent<br />
The other&rsquo;s use on Burges&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; sonne&rsquo;s be spent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same side, is a monument to the memory of John Moore,
Esq. who, at the age of fifty-eight, and having by his first wife
six sons and ten daughters, fell <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>desperately in love, which not being
returned, he died of a consumption, at Tenby: the following
epitaph is very allusive to his unfortunate catastrophe:</p>
<blockquote><p>He that from home for love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; was hither brought,<br />
Is now brought home, this God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; for him hath wrought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another monument to Morgan Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Igne probatur<br />
En animus rurfus clare in corpore<br />
Morgan Williams<br />
descended from the heiress of<br />
Robert Ferrar, Bishop of St. Davids<br />
Burnt alive by bigots under Q. Mary;<br />
was lately chief of Gargam<br />
and senior in council at<br />
Madras.<br />
Where Oct. 27, 1690, aged 49 years<br />
He resign&rsquo;d the President&rsquo;s chair<br />
and his breath together.<br />
An employment of full 30 years<br />
chronicles the continual<br />
approbation of his conduct<br />
particularly as<br />
chief commissioner of the circuit.</p>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
